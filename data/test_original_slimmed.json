The Customer shall comply with applicable laws, standards, policies, and procedures. The Customer incurs the responsibility to determine what restrictions apply and to review the policies and procedures that will be updated continually.

This includes, but is not limited to, the posting or transmitting on or through any of i-on's\n\n\n\n\n\nservices, any information that is, in i-on's sole discretion, unlawful, obscene, threatening, abusive, libelous, or harmful, or encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any local, state, national, or International law.\n\nThe Customer expressly agrees to use all of i-on's services only for lawful purposes. Transmission or storage of any information, data, or material in violation of United States or state regulation or law is prohibited, including but not limited to, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or any other statute.\n\nTERM AND TERMINATION\n\nThe term of this Agreement for the Hosted Site shall commence upon April 1, 1999 and shall continue for a period of six (6) months, unless earlier terminated in accordance with provisions hereof. This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for one (1) or more one (1) month periods unless either the Customer or i-on gives notice to the other party of its intention not to renew the\n\n4 Agreement, which notice must be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the end of the respective initial or renewal term.\n\nEither party may terminate this Agreement without cause at any time effective upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall relieve the Customer of the obligation to pay all amounts due to i-on and to make such payments on a timely basis.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\ni-on will not be liable under any circumstances for any lost profits or other consequential damages, even if i-on has been advised as to the possibility of such damages. i-on's liability for damages to the Customer for any cause whatsoever, regardless of the form of action, and whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, shall be limited to one (1) month's fees and the remaining portion of any prepaid fees.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION\n\nThe Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless i-on, against any lawsuits, claims, damages, or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) to which i-on may become subject related to or arising out of Customer's use of i-on's services, and will reimburse i-on for all legal and other expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in connection with investigating, defending, or settling any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action, or proceeding whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation in which i-on is a party. The provisions of this Agreement relating to indemnification shall survive termination of the Customer's Hosted Site.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE\n\ni-on expressly assumes no responsibility of the proper operation or maintenance of any of the Centrack site software that we authored by Imaginet and/or other third parties.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, and agreements between the Customer and i-on with respect to the subject matter hereof, all of which are merged herein. The parties understand that work i-on does in the development and maintenance of Web content and applications for Centrack International is governed by separate agreement(s).\n\nNothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to create a joint venture or partnership between the Customer and i-on. Neither party is, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, authorized as an agent or legal representative of the other party. Neither party is granted any such right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or implied, on behalf of or in the name of the other party or to bind such other party in any manner.\n\nNo waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of either party hereunder shall be effective, except pursuant to a written instrument signed by the party or parties waiving compliance, and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose stated in such writing.\n\nIn the event that any provision hereof is found invalid or unenforceable pursuant to judicial decree or decision, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.\n\nThis Agreement was entered into in the State of Florida, and its validity, construction, interpretation, and legal effect shall be governed by the laws and judicial decisions of the State of Florida applicable to contracts entered into and performed entirely within the State of Florida.\n\nNeither the Customer nor i-on shall be deemed in default if its performance or obligations hereunder are delayed or become impossible or impractical by reason of any act of God, war,\n\n5 fire, earthquake, labor dispute, sickness, accident, civil commotion, epidemic, act of government or government agency or offices, or any other cause beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch party's control.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.\n\nCENTRACK INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Promptly following receipt by Valeant of such list, but no later than [***] after receipt of the list of Target Professionals, Valeant may present to Dova a list of Target Professionals that, acting in good faith, it reasonably believes have a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practice in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology. For greater certainty, this list may include, but not be limited to, Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, for which Valeant wishes to confirm the primary specialty.\n\n6.5.2 Promptly following receipt by Dova of such list from Valeant, the Parties shall meet and discuss, acting reasonably and in good faith, such list and their appropriate primary specialty. If the parties agree that the Target Professional included on such list has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. In addition, if the Parties do not agree, but Valeant, acting reasonably and in good faith, still believes that the Target Professional has (or should have) a primary specialty designation of or otherwise currently practices in the specialty of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then Dova will submit an inquiry to Dova's Third Party Data Source for each such Target Professional, requesting that Dova's Third Party Data Source conduct an investigation to determine the primary specialty designation of each such Target Professional. The Parties shall equally share in the incremental costs to Dova of any such investigations by Dova's Third Party Data Source. For greater certainty, if, under Dova's agreement with Dova's Third Party Data Source, Dova is entitled to a certain number of investigations at no additional cost, and such investigations requested by Valeant causes Dova to incur additional costs that it would not have, but for such investigations requested by Valeant, then Valeant shall still be required to share in any costs of investigations (pursuant to Dova's Third Party Data Source's standard rates) that would otherwise be a no-cost investigations.

In the event that, following such investigation, Dova's Third Party Data source does not change the primary specialty designation to Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology or, in the case of those Target Professionals with a primary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology, changes the primary specialty designation to a specialty other than Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, then those Target Professionals shall be deemed not to be in the Specialty. For those Target Professionals that were not the subject of an inquiry to or an investigation by Dova's Third Party Data Source, then the specialty designations set out in the original list generated by Dova's Third Party Data Source shall apply for such Calendar Quarter, namely those Target Professionals that have either a\n\nSource: DOVA PHARMACEUTICALS INC., 10-Q, 11/8/2018\n\n\n\n\n\nprimary or a secondary specialty designation of Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology and that do not have either a primary or a secondary specialty designation of Hepatology shall be deemed to be in the Specialty.\n\n6.5.4 The process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated for each Calendar Quarter of the Term; provided, however, that, pursuant to the process described above, if Dova's Third Party Data Source has confirmed that a Target Professional's primary specialty designation should be or should remain Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery or Proctology, it is not necessary for Valeant to seek this confirmation in subsequent Calendar Quarters; provided, further, that, if Dova's Third Party Data Source is subsequently updated (by Dova or any Third Party) to change the specialty designation (primary or secondary) of a Target Professional, pursuant to a request by Dova or a Third Party, then the process described in this Section 6.5 shall be repeated with respect to such Target Professional.\n\nARTICLE 7  AUDIT RIGHTS\n\n7.1 Recordkeeping.

The Party seeking indemnification under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give prompt notice to the Party against whom indemnity is sought (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of the assertion or commencement of any Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to give such notice will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall assume and control the defense and settlement of any such action, suit or proceeding at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in such defense, at the Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnified Party will be entitled at its own expense to participate in such defense and to employ separate counsel for such purpose. For so long as the Indemnifying Party is diligently defending any proceeding pursuant to this Section 11.3, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, for any settlement effected without its consent. No Party shall enter into any compromise or settlement which commits the other Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action without the other Party's prior written consent (and unless such compromise or settlement includes no payments by the Indemnified Party, an unconditional release of, and no admission of liability by, the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim).\n\n11.4 Limitation of Liability.

THE FOREGOING SENTENCE SHALL NOT LIMIT (1) THE OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY TO INDEMNIFY THE OTHER PARTY FROM AND AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 11.1 OR 11.2, AS APPLICABLE, OR (2) DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-USE OBLIGATIONS IN ARTICLE 9.\n\n11.5 Insurance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that during the Term, it shall maintain, through purchase or self- insurance, adequate insurance, including products liability coverage and comprehensive general liability insurance, adequate to cover its obligations under this Agreement and which are consistent with normal business practices of prudent companies similarly situated.

Dova does not and will not maintain or procure any worker's compensation, healthcare, or other insurance for or on behalf of any Field Force Personnel, all of which shall be Valeant's sole responsibility.

(\"Dova\") (DOVA), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases where there is a high unmet need, and Salix Pharmaceuticals (\"Salix\"), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE/TSX: BHC), today announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote Dova's DOPTELET (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved DOPTELET on May 21, 2018 for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. DOPTELET represents the first thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication.\n\nThrombocytopenia, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with CLD that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million patients with CLD have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.\n\nAs part of the co-promotion arrangement, Salix intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote DOPTELET to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The Salix sales force will begin selling DOPTELET in mid-October 2018. Dova will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, Dova will pay Salix a quarterly fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of DOPTELET prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S.\n\n\"We are delighted to be working with Salix, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,\" said Alex C. Sapir, president and chief executive officer, Dova Pharmaceuticals. \"Given Salix's presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to DOPTELET and to patients.\"\n\n\"Salix considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with XIFAXAN\u00ae (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,\" said Mark McKenna, president, Salix Pharmaceuticals. \"Adding DOPTELET to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.\"\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

DOPTELET is designed to mimic the effects of TPO, the primary regulator of normal platelet production.\n\nTwo global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ADAPT-1 [N=231] and ADAPT-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/\u00b5L) and CLD, supported the FDA approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag daily for five days based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/\u00b5mL or <40,000/\u00b5mL, respectively). Avatrombopag was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding up to seven days following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg (ADAPT-1, 88% vs. 38%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 88% vs. 33%; p<0.0001), and 60 mg (ADAPT-1, 66% vs. 23%, p <0.0001; ADAPT-2, 69% vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. Avatrombopag was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of \u226550,000/\u00b5mL on procedure day, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to procedure day; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with CLD and in patients receiving TPO receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the ADAPT trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient.\n\nINDICATION\n\nDOPTELET (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n\nDOPTELET is a thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist and TPO receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with TPO receptor agonists. In the ADAPT-1 and ADAPT-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with DOPTELET.\n\nConsider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering DOPTELET to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).\n\nDOPTELET should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.\n\nCONTRAINDICATIONS: None\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It has been proven to reduce the risk of overt HE recurrence and HE-related hospitalizations in adults.\n\n*There is an increased systemic exposure in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to these patients.\n\nINDICATION  XIFAXAN (rifaximin) 550 mg tablets are indicated for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) recurrence in adults and for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN is not for everyone. Do not take XIFAXAN if you have a known hypersensitivity to rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents, or any of the components in XIFAXAN.\n\n\u2022If you take antibiotics, like XIFAXAN, there is a chance you could experience diarrhea caused by an overgrowth of bacteria (C. difficile). This can cause symptoms ranging in severity from mild diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Contact your healthcare provider if your diarrhea does not improve or worsens.\n\n\u2022Talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN if you have severe hepatic (liver) impairment, as this may cause increased effects of the medicine.\n\n\u2022Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking drugs called P-glycoprotein and/or OATPs inhibitors (such as cyclosporine) because using these drugs with XIFAXAN may lead to an increase in the amount of XIFAXAN absorbed by your body.\n\n\u2022In clinical studies, the most common side effects of XIFAXAN were: HE: Peripheral edema (swelling, usually in the ankles or lower limbs), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), dizziness, fatigue (feeling tired), and ascites (a buildup of fluid in the abdomen)  IBS-D: Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and an increase in liver enzymes\n\n\u2022XIFAXAN may affect warfarin activity when taken together. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking warfarin because the dose of warfarin may need to be adjusted to maintain proper blood-thinning effect.\n\n\u2022If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing, talk to your healthcare provider before taking XIFAXAN because XIFAXAN may cause harm to an unborn baby or nursing infant. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800- FDA-1088.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for epidural use. A single  injection of DepoDur into the lumbar epidural space may provide pain relief for up to 48 hours following major surgery without the restrictions and  potential complications associated with an indwelling epidural catheter.\n\n\"The product characteristics of DepoDur fit exceptionally well with EKR's acquisition model,\" said Howard Weisman, EKR's Chairman & CEO.  \"DepoDur is patent protected, addresses an important medical need in our market space, and has growth prospects that can be fully exploited through the application of EKR's expertise and strengths in the acute care market.\"\n\nMr. Weisman further noted, \"EKR is commencing a number of pre-launch activities, including interacting with opinion leaders, and we expect to  fully deploy our sales force in support of DepoDur early next year.\" He concluded, \"We are very optimistic about EKR's growth prospects in 2008  as we foresee a ramp up in sales for both DepoDur and Gelclair\u00ae and anticipate favorable market synergies between these products.\" Gelclair,  which is marketed to acute care facilities and cancer centers, is indicated for the management of pain associated with oral lesions of various  etiologies, including chemotherapy and radiation induced oral mucositis/stomatitis.\n\nTong Zhang, Ph.D., Director of Business Development for EKR, added, \"Acquiring the rights to DepoDur exemplifies EKR's strategy of focusing  on building a portfolio of premier products in the acute care space.\"  He further noted, \"Our strict acquisition criteria center on high-margin,  innovative products that offer value to healthcare providers and their patients, thus, representing excellent opportunities for EKR to realize strong  returns on investment.\"      -73-\n\n\n\n  SCHEDULE VI\n\n  PRESS RELEASE\n\n\u00ae\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pacira Pharmaceuticals is delighted to have EKR Therapeutics as our marketing and commercialization partner for DepoDur in the Americas,\"  commented Fred Middleton, Pacira's Chairman of the Board. \"This product was clinically developed as a proprietary treatment by Pacira R&D and  it received FDA approval in 2004 for long-acting post surgical pain management, for which it is known to be effective.\"\n\nMr. Middleton further noted, \"EKR Therapeutics has demonstrated in the past that they possess the strengths to successfully bringing a focused  marketing and clinician targeting approach to DepoDur to help it reach its full commercial potential. We look forward to working with EKR, as our  partner on the expanded commercial marketing of DepoDur.\"\n\nDetailed terms of the transaction were not disclosed. However, EKR did note that in addition to royalty payments on net sales, it has agreed to an  upfront payment amounting to somewhat more than [**] times DepoDur's 2006 U.S. sales. EKR has also agreed to certain milestone payments with the sum of upfront and milestone payments potentially worth up to $20 million.\n\nAbout EKR Therapeutics   EKR Therapeutics is a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company that has brought together a highly seasoned team of industry professionals The Company focuses on the acquisition, development and commercialization of proprietary products for the acute care segment of  the healthcare market, including oncology supportive care therapeutics.

The portions of the Agreement for which confidential treatment has been requested are marked with X's in brackets and such confidential portions have been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n                              PROMOTION AGREEMENT\n\nThis Promotion Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is dated as of January 26, 1998 between CNET, Inc. (\"CNET\") and Cyberian Outpost, Inc. (the \"Company\"). Pursuant to this Agreement, CNET will provide various links and other online and television promotions (collectively, the \"Promotions\") to the Company to assist the Company in promoting its products and services and facilitating the sale of products to potential buyers through its Internet site. CNET will be compensated by the Company for providing the Promotions. Accordingly, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n\n1.   Background.\n\n     1.1  The Company. The Company operates an electronic retailing operation           through its Internet sites located at www.cyberianoutpost.com or           www.outpost.com (together with any successors to such sites, the           \"Company Site\"). Through the Company Site, the Company sells or           facilitates the sale of various products and services, either directly           or as an agent for third party vendors. All products and services           offered for sale through the Company Site are referred to as the           \"Products.\"\n\n     1.2  CNET. CNET produces television programs and operates a network of           Internet sites on the world wide web. For purposes of this Agreement,           the \"CNET Sites\" refer to any Internet sites operated by CNET or its           subsidiaries, including without limitation the sites referenced in           Section 2.5 and Exhibit A.\n\n2.   CNET's Obligations.\n\n     2.1  TV Promotions. CNET will provide the Company one 15 second \"spot\" for           Promotions on its syndicated weekly TV program, TV.COM. Promotions           will run on each weekly episode of TV.COM during the Term; provided           that TV.COM remains on the air throughout such period. Should TV.COM           not be run on the air during a portion of the Term, CNET will run two           download.com banner advertising programs per month during such portion           of the Term in lieu of the foregoing TV.COM Promotions.\n\n     2.2  Banner Promotions. CNET will provide advertising banners to the           Company during the Term as described in Exhibit A.\n\n     2.3  Retail Promotions.\n\n            2.3.1  CNET will provide for various retail Promotions across the CNET                  Sites, which may include text/HTML links, buttons, portals and                  other fixed Promotions that include embedded links to the                  Company Site (the \"Retail Promotions\" and, together with the                  advertising banners contemplated in the preceding paragraph,                  the \"Online Promotions\").\n\n          2.3.2  Subject to Section 4 below, CNET will provide the Company with                  a total of at least (a) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the first three months of the Term, (b) [XXXXXX] Retail                  Impressions during the second three months of the Term, (c)                  [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during the third three months                  of the Term, and (d) [XXXXXX] Retail Impressions during                  the fourth three months of the Term. For such purposes, a                  \"Retail Impression\" means the display of one page of a CNET                  Site that contains at least one Retail Promotion. If CNET fails                  to provide the Retail Impressions required by the preceding                  sentence during the Term, then CNET will continue to display                  Retail Impressions in accordance with this Agreement following                  the Term (notwithstanding the termination or expiration of the                  Term) until the required number of Retail Impressions has been                  delivered.\n\n     2.4  Placement of Retail Promotions. CNET will determine the location and           type of each Retail Promotion displayed throughout the CNET Sites and           may phase in certain types of Retail Promotions as they are developed.           CNET currently intends to display Retail Promotions consisting of           text/HTML links, pre-filled with an appropriate query string or link           (\"Pre-Filled Links\"), as set forth in this Section. The Retail           Promotions contemplated by this Section will be displayed above the           fold where the graphical layout of the page reasonably permits such           positioning (as determined by CNET), and in other cases the Retail           Promotions will be prominently positioned below the fold.

CNET will provide all entry forms and operate the           production and sending of the newsletter. CNET agrees not to           specifically target these subscribers separately from the general\n\n\n\n\n\n          database of subscribers to CNET's various newsletters. Should the           Company provide a persistent link or series of links (as distinguished           from occasional and ad hoc links to product reviews either on the           Company Site or in any communication by the Company to its customers)           to a \"Technology Content Provider\", CNET shall be given at least equal           prominence to any other Technology Content Provider provided that CNET           offers comparable editorial content.

If      this Agreement is terminated during any of the three month periods      referenced in Section 2.3.2, then the required number of Retail Impressions      applicable thereunder to such three month period will be pro rated      accordingly.\n\n5.   Exclusivity. For purposes of this agreement \"Competing Computer Products      Retailer\" means any company other than the Company that is engaged in the      retail sale of computer products, with the exception of CNET Direct, which      operates BuyDirect.com. During the Term, CNET will not enter into more than      two other agreements under which CNET receives consideration from a      Competing Computer Products Retailer for displaying permanent links to or      other fixed promotions for such Competing Computer Products Retailer on any      CNET Site; provided that the foregoing will not restrict the display of(a)      standard advertisements for any Competing Computer Products Retailer or its      products or (b) any promotions within COMPUTERS.COM or within CNET's Snap!      Online service (which are expressly excluded from this provision). The      parties acknowledge that the foregoing will not prevent CNET from      displaying text links and other references to Competing Computer Products      Retailers as reasonably necessary to provide appropriate editorial and      search related services on the CNET Sites. The Retail Promotions granted to      the Company shall be placed in such a way as to provide no more or less      prominence to the Company than is provided to any other Competing Computer      Retailer signing an agreement with CNET.\n\n6.  Trademark Licenses.\n\n     6.1  The Company hereby grants to CNET a non-exclusive, royalty-free           license, effective throughout the Term, to use, display and publish           any of the Company trademarks, tradenames, service marks and logos           that may be delivered by the Company to CNET expressly for inclusion           in the Promotions, solely for use in connection with the Promotions.           Any use of the Company Marks by CNET must comply with any reasonable           usage guidelines communicated by the Company to CNET from time to           time. Nothing contained in this Agreement will give CNET any right,           title or interest in or to the Company Marks or the goodwill           associated therewith, except for the limited usage rights expressly           provided above. CNET acknowledges and agrees that, as between the           Company and CNET, the Company is the sole owner of all rights in and           to the Company Marks.\n\n     6.2  The Company hereby represents and warrants to CNET that the Company           has, and will have throughout the Term, all necessary rights in and to           the Company Marks to grant CNET the licenses and usage rights           contemplated by this Agreement without violating the rights of any           third party.\n\n  7.

CNET is not      authorized to make, and agrees not to make, any representations or      warranties concerning the Products, except to the extent (if any) contained      within Promotions delivered to CNET by the Company.\n\n8.   Mutual Indemnification.\n\n     8.1  Indemnification by CNET. CNET shall indemnify and hold the Company           harmless from and against any costs, losses, liabilities and expenses,           including all court costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable           attorney's fees (collectively, \"Losses\") that the Company may suffer,           incur or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,           arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by CNET of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; or (b) the operation of the CNET Sites (except in cases           where the Company is required to indemnify CNET under the following           paragraph), including claims of infringement or misappropriation of           intellectual property rights.\n\n     8.2  Indemnification by the Company. The Company shall indemnify and hold           CNET harmless from and against any Losses that CNET may suffer, incur           or be subjected to by reason of any legal action, proceeding,\n\n\n\n\n\n          arbitration or other claim by a third party, whether commenced or           threatened, arising out of or as a result of (a) any breach or alleged           breach by the Company of its representations, warranties or covenants           hereunder; (b) the use by CNET of the Company Marks or any content           provided by the Company to CNET expressly for display in connection           with or as part of the Promotions, including claims of infringement or           misappropriation of intellectual property rights; or (c) the operation           of the Company Site or the offer or sale of the Products by the           Company or through the Company Site.\n\n     8.3  Indemnification Procedures. If any party entitled to indemnification           under this section (an \"Indemnified Party\") makes an indemnification           request to the other, the Indemnified Party shall permit the other           party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") to control the defense, disposition           or settlement of the matter at its own expense; provided that the           Indemnifying Party shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified           Party enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition that           imposes an obligation on the Indemnified Party that is not wholly           discharged or dischargeable by the Indemnifying Party, or imposes any           conditions or obligations on the Indemnified Party other than the           payment of monies that are readily measurable for purposes of           determining the monetary indemnification or reimbursement obligations           of Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall\n\n            notify Indemnifying Party promptly of any claim for which Indemnifying           Party is responsible and shall cooperate with Indemnifying Party in           every commercially reasonable way to facilitate defense of any such           claim; provided that the Indemnified Party's failure to notify           Indemnifying Party shall not diminish Indemnifying Party's obligations           under this Section except to the extent that Indemnifying Party is           materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. An Indemnified           Party shall at all times have the option to participate in any matter           or litigation through counsel of its own selection and at its own           expense.\n\n9.

Such consent lies in the entire discretion of the Party  owning the Confidential Information and     10\n\n\n\n\n\n     without prejudice to that, the Party's consent may be conditional upon the third party entering into a confidentiality or non-disclosure  agreement with the owner of the Confidential Information prior to any disclosure being made.     11.5 Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party if it becomes aware of any unauthorised use or disclosure by any Authorised Person or any  other person of any Confidential Information.     11.6 A Party may disclose any Confidential Information to any regulator, law enforcement agency or other third party if it is required to do so by  law, regulation, or similar authority.

This Agreement (including its Exhibit A and all other documents referenced herein) is entered into by eGain Communications Corporation (\"eGain\") and Eliance Corporation (\"Customer\") for the purpose of providing Customer with Web-based access to eGain's software specified in Exhibit A, including any updates, upgrades or revisions provided under this Agreement (\"Software\"), and certain other services relating to the processing of and response to online inquiries and messages (\"Online Messages\") received by Customer from its customers and other users of Customer's Web site (\"Users\").\n\n2. Provision of Services. eGain will provide Customer with access, maintenance and related hosting services (\"Hosting Services\") to the Software installed on eGain's servers and other equipment (the \"eGain System\"). Customer agrees, as reasonably requested by eGain, to provide eGain with access to Customer's premises and equipment and to otherwise cooperate with eGain in performing the services. During the term of this Agreement, Customer may obtain information (\"Reports\") regarding Customer's use of the Software and the quantity and handling of Online Messages routed to the eGain System by accessing the eGain System through a password-protected Web site made available by eGain. Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of such passwords and shall permit only authorized employees of Customer to access the eGain System. The Hosting Services, and the hosting fees specified in Exhibit A, do not include any deployment, training or other consulting or professional services which, if applicable, will be specified in a Statement of Work, signed by both parties, and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n2.1 Customer Support. eGain will provide live telephone support to Customer 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week by a trained eGain customer support representative.\n\n3. Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder. The eGain System is only to be used for lawful purposes. Customer agrees not to transmit, re-transmit or store materials on or through the eGain System or the Software that are harmful to the eGain System or Software, or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation laws relating to infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. To the extent that certain components of the Software may be downloaded to Customer's or User's computer as a result of accessing the Software as part of the Hosting Services, eGain grants Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license, with right to sublicense solely to Users, to use such Software only in connection with the Hosting Services. Neither Customer nor Users are otherwise permitted to use the Software, nor will Customer or Users disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of such Software. Customer agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Section and in Section 11, it will not rent, lease, sublicense, re-sell, time-share or otherwise assign to any third party this Agreement or any of Customer's rights or licenses to access the Software or the eGain System, nor shall Customer use, or authorize others to use, the Software, Hosting Services or the eGain System to operate a service bureau. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Customer shall be permitted to provide access to the eGain System to its employees and agents located worldwide.\n\n4. Proprietary Rights. Except for the limited access right granted to Customer in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any and all modifications as a result of any implementation services rendered) and the eGain System are and shall remain the exclusive property of eGain and its licensors. eGain acknowledges and agrees that the Online Messages are the property of Customer and that eGain has only a limited right to use the Online Messages as set forth in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain may access and disclose the Online Messages solely as necessary to provide the Hosting Services, to operate and maintain its systems, to comply with applicable laws and government orders and requests, and to protect itself and its customers.\n\n5. Pricing and Payment. Customer agrees to pay the fees and other charges for the Hosting Services and other services provided under this Agreement as specified in Exhibit A of this Agreement. CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain. With these limited exceptions, eGain agrees that it may not use Customer's name, logo or any other trademarks (including in any press releases, customer \"case studies,\" and the like) without Customer's prior consent.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A and any other exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of its conflict of laws principles. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to the party at its last-provided address, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by e-mail (with confirmation of receipt) or conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested). Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to constitute eGain and Customer as partners or joint venturers or\n\n\n\n\n\neither party as an agent of the other. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent shall be required for an assignment of this Agreement made pursuant to a merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of a party. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nEach party agrees to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\n\nCustomer: Eliance Corporation\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________\n\neGain Communications Corporation:\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________"

The omitted portions, marked by [****], have been separately filed with the Commission.\n\n                           SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT\n\nThis agreement (\"Agreement\") is entered into as of the 23rd day of September, 1997 (\"Effective Date\"), by and between Excite, Inc., a California corporation, located at 555 Broadway, Redwood City, California 94063 (\"Excite\"), and N2K Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, located at 55 Broad Street, 26th Floor, New York, New York, 10004 (\"Sponsor\").\n\n                                 RECITALS\n\nA.   Excite maintains a site on the Internet at http://www.excite.com (the      \"Excite Site\") and owns and/or manages related Web Sites worldwide      (collectively, the \"Excite Network\") which, among other things, allow users      to search for and access content and other sites on the Internet.\n\nB.   Excite also maintains and/or manages certain Web pages which may be      delivered to users via email, desktop \"channels\" or Internet \"push\"      technologies (collectively, \"Broadcast Pages\") which may incorporate      content supplied to Excite by third parties for the purpose of providing      value to Excite users and providing access to the content, products and/or      services of such third parties.\n\nC.   Sponsor is in the business of distributing certain online retail music      merchandise and related content and maintains a Web site at      http://www.musicblvd.com (the \"Sponsor Site\") and other Web sites through      which it makes this merchandise and this content available to its users.\n\nD.   Sponsor wishes to be the exclusive retail store music sponsor of the Excite      Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages, to distribute its music-related      content through the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages and to      promote its online retail music merchandise business to Excite.com users.\n\nTherefore, the parties agree as follows:\n\n1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL\n\n      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. \"Retail Music Store\" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. \"Music Products\"     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).\n\n              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.\n\n      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The \"Commencement Date\" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties                  anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October                  15, 1997.\n\n      c)      The parties' existing agreements regarding sponsorship of the                  WebCrawler Web site (http://webcrawler.com) and all of the                  existing advertising buys on the Excite Network will be                  terminated as of the Commencement Date. Excite will credit                  Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will be\n\n\n\n\n\n              applied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in                  Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's                  December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).\n\n      d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to                  negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.\n\n                                    2    3                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               i) Excite will not propose, solicit or negotiate offers from                   entities other than Sponsor for any retail music store                   sponsorships of the Excite Site, if at all, until [****] prior                   to the expiration of the term of this Agreement.\n\n               ii) Commencing not later than [****] prior to the expiration                   of the term of the Agreement, Excite will negotiate with                   Sponsor in good faith with respect to the terms and conditions                   under which this Agreement would be renewed. Excite will                   negotiate exclusively with Sponsor for the next [****] in good                   faith effort to negotiate and execute a written sponsorship                   renewal agreement. If, [****] prior to the expiration of the                   term of the Agreement, the parties have not entered into a                   written sponsorship renewal agreement. Excite may enter into                   negotiations with any third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site.\n\n               iii) In the event that Excite intends to enter into an                   agreement with a third party with respect to retail music                   store sponsorships of the Excite Site before the expiration of                   the term of the Agreement, Excite will deliver to Sponsor a                   written notice describing the relevant opportunity. Although                   Excite will not be required to disclose any information in                   violation of any nondisclosure agreement between Excite and                   any third party, the notice will include information                   sufficient to permit Sponsor to evaluate the requirements for                   meeting the competing offer for retail music store sponsorship                   of the Excite Site and to formulate a meaningful response.                   Sponsor will have [****] after receipt of such written notice                   to provide notice to Excite that it is prepared to enter into                   an agreement with Excite on the same terms and conditions as                   Excite proposes to accept from such third party. Excite and                   Sponsor will then promptly commence good faith negotiations to                   conclude the agreement.\n\n               iv) If Sponsor rejects said offer or fails to notify Excite of                   its acceptance within the [****] period, Excite shall have                   the right thereafter to enter into the agreement with such                   third party, provided the terms and conditions of the                   agreement (if entered into within the subsequent ninety (90)                   days) are not less favorable to Excite than previously offered                   by Sponsor.\n\n                                    3    4                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n2.       IMPRESSIONS\n\n      a)       \"Impression\" means any appearance of a link to the Sponsor                   Site whether graphic, text or any combination of graphic and                   text. More than one Impression may appear on a page, except,                   however, not more than three (3) Impressions per Channel page                   will count towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of                   these 3 Impressions, at least two (2) will link to pages in                   the Sponsor Site offering Music Products; not more than two                   (2) Impressions per generic search results page will count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions and, of these 2                   Impressions, at least one (1) will link to pages in the                   Sponsor Site offering Music Products; and no more than one (1)                   Impression per specific search results page will count towards                   delivery of guaranteed Impressions. In all events, Excite will                   make a good faith effort to avoid duplicate Impressions on a                   single page, but in no event will more than one (1)                   Impression for the same artist on a Music Product page count                   towards delivery of guaranteed Impressions. For the purposes                   of this Agreement, \"generic search results page\" is an Excite                   Search results page displayed in response to a query                   concerning generic music topics and a \"specific search results                   page\" is an Excite Search results page displayed in response                   to a query concerning a specific music artist or specific                   album title.\n\n      b)      Excite and Sponsor will work together in good faith to define                  mutually agreeable Impressions in the Excite Site designed to                  provide content of interest (defined below) to Excite users                  and/or promote the Sponsor Site, in numbers sufficient to meet                  the Impression guarantees stated in Section 3.\n\n      c)      Excite and Sponsor will collaborate on the design, appearance,                  and placement (the \"look and feel\") of all Impressions. Excite\n\n\n\n\n\n              will have final approval over the look and feel of the                  promotional Impressions, which approval will not be                  unreasonably withheld.\n\n3.       IMPRESSION GUARANTEES\n\n      a)       During the first year of the sponsorship following the                   Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not less than                   [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n      b)       During the second year of the sponsorship following the first                   anniversary of the Commencement Date, Excite will deliver not                   less than [****] Impressions on the Excite Site.\n\n                                    4    5                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n      c)       Excite will report traffic, Impressions and click-thrus to                   Sponsor on a monthly basis.\n\n4.

This                            three-month Total Revenue amount will be compared to                            an amount equal to two (2) times the corresponding                            three-month share of the applicable sponsorship fee                            described in Sections 6(c) and 6(d) (each pro rata                            share a \"Revenue Floor\").\n\n                                    8    9                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               iii)     If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period exceeds the total of the Revenue                            Floor applicable to the same three-month period,                            Sponsor will pay Excite [****] of the gross margin                            Sponsor realizes on the gross revenue amount equal to                            the excess of the Total Revenue over the Revenue                             Floor during the three-month period.                   iv)      If the Total Revenue earned by Sponsor during the                            three-month period does not exceed the Revenue Floor                            applicable to the same three-month period, Sponsor                            will not be obligated to pay Excite any share of the                            gross revenue realized during the three-month period.\n\n      g)       Payments of shared gross margin will be due to Excite within                   thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar quarter in which                   the revenue is recognized by Sponsor.\n\n      h)       With each payment, Sponsor will provide to Excite                   documentation reasonably detailing the calculation of the                   payment.\n\n      i)       Sponsor will maintain accurate records with respect to the                   calculation of all payments due under this Agreement. Excite                   may, upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice                   to Sponsor, cause an independent Certified Public Accountant                   to inspect the records of Sponsor reasonably related to the                   calculation of such payments during Sponsor's normal business                   hours. The fees charged by such Certified Public Accountant in                   connection with the inspection will be paid by Excite unless                   the payments made to Excite are determined to have been less                   than ninety percent (90%) of the payment owed to Excite, in                   which case Sponsor will be responsible for the payment of the                   reasonable fees for such inspection.\n\n8.

If Excite fails to \"make good\" the shortfall within                   [****] following the first year end, Sponsor may terminate the                   Agreement in accordance with Section 11 (b).\n\n      b)       If Excite fails to deliver the guaranteed number of                   Impressions on the Excite Site during the second year, Excite                   will use commercially reasonable efforts to \"make good\" the                   shortfall within [****] following the second year end.                   However, the term of this Agreement will continue until Excite                   has made good the guaranteed number of Impressions on the                   Excite Site. Sponsor will not be obligated to make                   sponsorship, advertising or exclusivity payments to Excite                   during the \"make good\" period after the second year of the                   Agreement, but Sponsor will continue to make revenue sharing                   payments as described in Section 7(e). For the purposes of the                   calculation of revenue sharing during this \"make good\" period                   only, the \"Revenue Floor\" from the last quarter of the second                   year of the term of the Agreement will apply.          c)       Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party                   materially breaches its obligations hereunder and such breach                   remains uncured for thirty (30) days following the notice to                   the breaching party of the breach, with the following                   exceptions:\n\n               i)       Excite will promptly notify Sponsor of any errors,                            failures or outages of the Content. Sponsor will                            promptly notify Excite of any errors, failures or                            outages of the Co-Branded Area.\n\n                                    11    12                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n                        Sponsor will take all reasonable measures to correct                            any such errors or outages as soon as reasonably                            possible.

Any delay in or failure of performance by                   either party under this Agreement will not be considered a                   breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent                   caused by any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of such                   party including,\n\n                                    16    17                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL\n\n               but not limited to, acts of God, power outages and                   governmental restrictions.\n\n      f)       Severability. In the event that any of the provisions of this                   Agreement are held by to be unenforceable by a court or                   arbitrator, the remaining portions of the Agreement will                   remain in full force and effect.\n\n      g)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive                   agreement between the parties with respect to the subject                   matter hereof, superseding any prior agreements and                   communications (both written and oral) regarding such subject                   matter.

REGARDING DEVELOPMENT OF WATER WELL(S) IN THE CAPITAN REEF AQUIFER FORMATION\n\nThis AGREEMENT regarding development of water well(s) in the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation (the \"AGREEMENT\") is entered into by the City of Fort Stockton, Texas, a Texas Type A-General Law city (\"COFS\") and STW Resources Holding Corp., a Nevada corporation (\"STW\"), effective as of the last date of signature on the signature pages below. STW and COFS are sometimes individually referred to as a \"Party\" and collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\"\n\nWHEREAS, the City of Fort Stockton, Texas (\"COFS\") owns the surface and groundwater rights to several areas of the Capitan Reef Aquifer Formation; and\n\nWHEREAS, COFS has an existing Capitan Reef Aquifer (\"CRA\") water well located at Section 112 on COFS property, which is currently drilled to an approximate depth of 3,500 feet (the \"Existing CRA Well\"), and also owns property at Section 71; and\n\nWHEREAS, STW desires to attempt to deepen the Existing CRA Well in order to make it a producing water well and/or drill an alternate well(s) at its own expense, and to lease CRA groundwater rights from Sections 112 and 71 of COFS property; and   WHEREAS, STW and COFS desire to work together for the development of a CRA water supply project within the area that will serve to meet the future needs of COFS and the municipal and industrial needs within the region.\n\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1.  Leasing of Property  and Drilling  of Water Well(s). COFS hereby grants, leases and lets unto STW the right to explore for, drill for, produce, utilize, transport, and treat groundwater from the CRA only from beneath the surface of the property more specifically described in Exhibit \"A,\" which is attached hereto and fully incorporated into this AGREEMENT (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Property\"). STW is further authorized to drill, deepen, and/or rework at its expense the Existing CRA Well on Section 112 of the Property from its current depth of approximately 3,500 feet to approximately 4,000 feet, so as to determine the following to be verified by a study to be performed by a hydrogeologist mutually agreed upon by both Parties (\"Post-Well Study\"): (a) the gallons per day (\"GPD\") of maximum water capacity of the Existing CRA Well or alternate well, as may be required under Section 5 of the AGREEMENT; and (b) the quality of the water to be obtained from the Existing CRA Well or alternate well. The rights granted to STW under this AGREEMENT also include the right of access to the Property to perform the activities authorized herein.   2.  Acces s and Surface Use. STW agrees to coordinate reasonably with COFS with respect to location of any new wells, roadways, power infrastructure, and other improvements that are to be constructed or used on the Property. COFS shall provide STW rent free site leases for the commercially reasonable amounts of surface area required for CRA pumping and filling stations located on the Property. STW shall pay for or repair all actual damages to roads, fences, or improvements caused by its activities on the Property within sixty (60) days of the occurrence, and will fill and level all pits, mounds, ruts, and shall restore the surface to as near its original condition as is reasonably practicable within ninety (90) days after termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property. Upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to the Property only, STW, or its successors or assigns, shall transfer title of all water conveyance pipelines from the Property to COFS. STW shall administer and provide all necessary and reasonable insurance to insure its activities on the Property in relation to the AGREEMENT and shall list COFS as additional insured.\n\n  -1-\n\n\n\n\n\n    3.  Term.  Subject to the other provisions contained herein, this AGREEMENT shall be for a term of thirty (30) years from the Effective Date, which shall automatically renew from year-to-year thereafter unless terminated by a Party upon sixty (60) days' written notice after the end of the term. Notwithstanding the 30-year term of this agreement, should STW procure sales agreements with customers for a duration of longer than 30 years, STW shall be authorized to maintain and service such contract(s) to the extent of the water volume(s) purchased, and this AGREEMENT shall not terminate during the initial term of any such water supply agreement with a term extending beyond this AGREEMENT.   4.  Post-Well  Study Generally. The Post-Well Study shall provide information on the feasibility of developing a water well field in that location that would produce water from the CRA for: (a) the availability of a minimum 1,200 gallons per minute (\"GPM\") per day CRA water production for STW, its successors or assignees, to sell to communities and users within a 500-mile radius outside of COFS (the \"Permitted Sale Water\") during the Term, with the further requirement that STW would be responsible for the pipelines and pumping facilities required to transport the Permitted Sale Water to the intended end-users; and that all such water obtained from the Existing CRA Well contains acceptable levels of Total Dissolved Solids (\"TDS\") to meet municipal use standards. If such water does not meet municipal use standards according to the Post-Well Study, STW may either treat the water to municipal use standards or to sell it as-is to industrial end-users.   5.  Replacement CRA Well. If, based on the Post-Well Study of the Existing CRA Well, it is determined that the Existing CRA Well is not suitable for the purposes of this AGREEMENT, then STW may elect to drill at its expense a second water well (the \"Replacement CRA Well\") at a place to be mutually agreed on the Property, with the Existing CRA Well to remain as a monitoring well. After completion of the Replacement CRA Well, a second Post-Well Study will be conducted for the same purposes as that for the Existing CRA Well.   6.  Construction Requirements. STW's construction of the improvements to the Existing CRA Well, any Replacement CRA Well, and any additional production wells shall be pursuant to any recommendation and requirements as may be specified by and agreed upon with COFS, and the construction shall also be conducted in a manner meeting prevailing industry standards, the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District regulations, Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulations, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) regulations.   7.  Cooperation  Regarding  Studies. COFS shall provide to STW any and all documents pertaining to this project, including all hydrogeological studies and any existing Pre-Well Studies for the Existing CRA Well, as well as any similar documents for the Replacement CRA Well to include:   a.  the best location for the Replacement CRA Well on the Property, considering the spacing with any other wells that might now or in the future be located on the Property;   b.  the location on the Property that will best provide data for determining the feasibility of pumping water from the CRA on the Property and be the most productive;   c.  documents showing current ownership of the Property including both CRA and surface ownership rights, to demonstrate COFS' ability to lease the land for the Sale of CRA Water Rights to STW, including any documents showing the prior sale or conveyance of any CRA or water rights from the Property; and   d.  names and addresses of engineers and/or hydrogeologists recommended to perform the Post-Well Study (ies). The Post-Well Study (ies) shall be performed by a hydrogeologist(s) mutually agreed to by both Parties.\n\n  -2-\n\n\n\n\n\n    8.  Post-Well Study Requirements. Any Post-Well Studies shall be paid for by STW and shall include:   a.  a chemical analysis and performance by a qualified certified laboratory mutually approved by the Parties to determine the quality of the water and its characteristics at that location;   b.  any documents related to the drawdown or recharge rate affecting the producing capacity; and   c.  TDS measurements of CRA water produced by STW.   9.  COFS Responsibilities.   COFS shall perform the following services:   a.  administer and provide all necessary insurance to insure its activities in relation to the AGREEMENT; and   b.  possess or obtain any and all necessary property rights for the activities covered in this AGREEMENT, including both CRA and surface rights to the Property.   10.  Construction and Post-Well Study Costs.  STW will pay all reasonable and necessary costs to: (a) construct the improvements to the Existing CRA Well or the Replacement CRA Well (including the cost of securing any necessary regulatory approval for the improvements to the Existing CRA Well and the Replacement CRA Well); (b) obtain the Post-Well Study (ies); and (c) reasonable consulting costs related to the negotiation and execution of the AGREEMENT.   11.  STW Termination Rights. STW shall have the right to unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related only to the Property, and not proceed further after the completion of any phase of the project and not incur any additional costs. So long as STW is progressing through the following phases, and subject to the other terms of this AGREEMENT, COFS may not terminate the AGREEMENT during the:   a.  Pre-well study (ies),   b.  completion of improvements to the Existing CRA Well,   c.  completion of the Replacement CRA Well, if necessary, and   d.  Post-Well Study (ies).   Should COFS unilaterally terminate the provisions of this AGREEMENT related to COFS Property only, with the right to do so beginning on a period beginning no sooner than ninety (90) days following the Post-Well Study (ies), and ending at the one year period following the Post-Well Study (ies), during which STW may exercise its Option to Produce Water, in accordance with Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, COFS shall reimburse STW for 100% of the costs paid by STW up to the point of such termination, pursuant to the AGREEMENT, according to a reasonable accounting schedule of costs prepared by STW and submitted to COFS. Once STW exercises its Option to Produce Water pursuant to Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, and pays COFS its Bonus Payment, in accordance with Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT, COFS may no longer unilaterally terminate this AGREEMENT during the Term. If STW terminates the AGREEMENT and COFS sells water within twenty (20) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT from one or more producing water well(s) developed by STW, STW shall be reimbursed the amount expended for drilling the producing well(s), to be paid from the sale of water produced by COFS from the producing well(s). Such reimbursement shall occur based on COFS' net revenues received from CRA water sales from the producing well(s) in six (6) month increments, which shall begin on the date COFS begins selling CRA water from producing water well(s), and shall end upon reimbursement in full of the amount STW is owed for drilling any producing well(s).\n\n  -3-\n\n\n\n\n\n    12.  Title of Producing Wells. Title and ownership of the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any additional wells drilled on the Property by STW (the \"Additional Wells\") shall be transferred to STW by COFS and shall be held by STW; however, upon termination of the provisions of this AGREEMENT that relate to COFS Property, STW shall transfer the title(s) back to COFS upon COFS' reimbursement of STW as necessary under this AGREEMENT.   13.  Uses, Maintenance, Construction and Operation of Wells. STW will construct, maintain, operate, own, and repair (as needed) the Existing CRA Well, the Replacement CRA Well and any Additional Wells, and in doing so, and in the wells' operation and repair, STW shall:   a.  conduct all work and operations in a businesslike manner consistent with good and economical practices and with due regard for good land management, damage prevention and environmental protection;   b.  comply with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations and requirements governing the development, production, collection, transportation, and disposal of the water (and any waste or reject water);   c.  allow COFS or its authorized representatives to enter upon the premises at reasonable times to be arranged in advance of entry; and   d.  plug all wells, when abandoned, in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements of the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District, TDLR, and/or TCEQ.   14.  Obligations Following the Post-Well Study.   a.  For purposes of this section, the Post-Well Study must show that the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well can produce CRA water at a minimum of 1,200 GPM or more or a combination of 1,200 GPM from one or more wells on the Property in order for STW to proceed with the obligations set forth in this section (\"Critical Criterion\").   b.  Obligations if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has been met:   If all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained that allow the production and transport of up to 10 million GPD or the maximum capacity of the well, for STW's use or resale, in conjunction with STW exercising its Option to Produce Water under Section 15 of this AGREEMENT, STW will pay COFS an upfront Bonus Payment of Five Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), and STW shall have the immediate right to develop Additional Wells on the Property, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals, in the event STW procures additional water supply contracts that require additional volume of production, the feasibility of which shall be by a Post Well hydrogeological study and report that shows the ability of STW to produce the additional amounts of CRA water. STW shall have the right to the sale of and transport of such additional water produced from Additional Wells. STW shall pay COFS a seventeen percent (17%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from the Property and sold.   STW shall also provide to COFS three (3) million GPD of CRA water at no cost to COFS at such time that COFS requests delivery of the water for COFS use. Each payment made by STW to COFS will include an accounting statement providing the number of gallons sold, the price paid by any customer(s), the gross revenues received by STW, and the expenses paid by STW for the sale, treatment, use, and/or delivery of the CRA water. STW shall calculate the amount owed to COFS every one hundred-eighty (180) days (\"Accrual Period\"), and shall provide required payments to COFS within thirty (30) days after the end of the previous Accrual Period.\n\n  -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n    c.  Options if Post-Well Study shows that the Critical Criterion has not been met:   (1)  STW may choose to not pursue the production and transport of the water from the Property. If one or more producing wells are developed by STW and COFS sells the CRA water produced from the well(s), COFS will reimburse STW from the net revenues COFS receives up to the point STW has been fully reimbursed for drilling any producing well(s) if such sale occurs within twenty (20) years from the date of this AGREEMENT.   (2)  STW may choose to pursue the production and transport of the water. STW shall have the right to produce and transport the water upon obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, and will not seek reimbursement of any of its costs incurred pursuant to the AGREEMENT.   (3)  If regulatory approvals have been granted, but the permit obtained from the Middle Pecos Groundwater Conservation District allows the transport of less than the full amount requested for STW's use or sale, then STW may:   i.  elect to produce and transport the water; or   ii.  elect to not produce and transport the water, in which case the conditions of Subsection (c)(1) of this section shall apply.   15.  Option to Produce Water.   a.  STW will have one year from completion of the last of the Post-Well Study (ies) completed on the Existing CRA Well or Replacement CRA Well to exercise its option to produce and transport the water produced from the CRA on the Property (\"Option to Produce\"). The AGREEMENT shall thereafter terminate as to both Parties if STW has not exercised its Option to Produce at the expiration of the one-year period unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month the sum of Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($500.00) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three consecutive years.   b.  If, after STW has exercised its option to produce CRA water from the Property, one or more producing wells on the Property are capable of producing CRA water for sale, but CRA water is not being sold for a consecutive period of 180 days or more, then the lease shall terminate as to both parties unless STW pays as royalty on the first day of each month after such period of 180 days, the sum of Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000) per month. STW shall have no right to maintain this AGREEMENT through payment of such a royalty for any one period greater than three (3) consecutive years.   c.  If STW exercises its option to produce and transport the CRA water, STW will construct additional facilities or expand existing facilities, as necessary, to be able to produce and transport the CRA water for sale.     -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n    16.  Payment for Use of COFS Pipeline Easements and COFS Assistance with Project.   a.  STW shall be entitled to use existing COFS easements and right of ways within Pecos County for laying of pipelines necessary for the delivery of CRA water produced within Pecos County. COFS will assist STW with any negotiations required to procure any additional easements and groundwater rights in Pecos County that are necessary for the production and delivery of CRA water. STW shall also be entitled to use and upgrade existing COFS water treatment infrastructure as necessary for the treatment of raw CRA water. STW shall pay COFS a seven percent (7%) royalty of the price STW receives per 1,000 gallons of CRA water produced from other properties within Pecos County and sold as consideration for the rights provided by COFS to STW under this subsection. Such payment shall be made according to the schedule and terms set forth in Section 14(b) of this AGREEMENT. The requirements under this Section 16 shall remain in force and effect despite any termination of those provisions of this AGREEMENT that apply only to COFS Property. The provisions of this section shall terminate in the event STW is not producing CRA water from other properties in Pecos County for sale due to termination of all such agreements or failure of STW to enter into such agreements regarding other properties in Pecos County within ten (10) years from the Effective Date of this AGREEMENT.   b.  COFS shall manage well maintenance and production operations for all CRA water produced within Pecos County under the direction of STW. STW shall pay COFS for its reasonable costs incurred to manage such well maintenance and production operations.   c.  STW shall conduct all necessary storage, holding, and treatment of CRA water produced from the Property and from other properties within Pecos County, as set forth in Subsection (a) of this section, within the boundaries of Pecos County.   17.  Authorized Third Party Beneficiary.   STW shall be listed as a third party beneficiary to any contracts to guarantee payment of any of the obligations of this contract between COFS and Pecos County or any other entity or individual.   18.  Venue. This AGREEMENT is controlled by the laws of the State of Texas, and venue for any actions brought to enforce this AGREEMENT shall be brought exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in Pecos County, Texas.   19.  Authority. The Parties executing this AGREEMENT represent that they have full and actual authority to sign and to be bound by this AGREEMENT.   20.  Taxes and Fees. STW shall pay all taxes, fees, assessments, and costs associated with the rights, pumping, and use of the CRA water from the Property and other properties in Pecos County. COFS shall bear and pay any ad valorem taxes assessed directly against COFS' royalty, any federal or state income taxes payable on the royalty and on the other compensation payable to COFS under this AGREEMENT, and taxes assessed on COFS' ownership of the surface of the Property and other minerals not conveyed under this AGREEMENT.   21.  Governmental Authority. STW shall be responsible for obtaining any approval required from any applicable governmental authority with jurisdiction over the activities under this AGREEMENT. COFS shall assist STW with any documentation needed to obtain the necessary approvals required.\n\n  -6-\n\n\n\n\n\n    22.  Force Majeure. If a Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, to carry out any of its obligations under the Agreement, other than an obligation to pay money, as a result of Force Majeure, then its obligations shall be suspended, to the extent affected by such Force Majeure, during the continuance of any inability so caused, provided that notice of the Force Majeure is provided to the other Party as soon as reasonably practicable. The Party claiming the Force Majeure shall use due diligence to resume performance at the earliest practicable time, and such suspension shall not extend for a period longer than twenty-four (24) months from the date notice of the Force Majeure is provided without payment as set forth under Section 15(a) of this AGREEMENT by STW, or the option to terminate this AGREEMENT by STW if COFS is the party asserting the Force Majeure.   23.  Notice of Breach. In the event of default by any Party, a non-defaulting party may give the defaulting party written notice specifying the default. If the defaulting party fails to fully cure any monetary default that can be cured by payment within sixty (60) days after receipt of the notice, or fails to commence the curing of any default specified in such notice that is other than a monetary default within sixty (60) days from the date of the notice provided, then the non-defaulting party may pursue all legal or equitable remedies against the defaulting party.   24.

Where any sum due to be paid to either Party hereunder is subject to any withholding or similar tax, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to do all such acts and things and to sign all such documents as will enable them to take advantage of any applicable double taxation agreement or treaty. In the event there is no applicable double taxation agreement or treaty, or if an applicable double taxation agreement or treaty reduces but does not eliminate such withholding or similar tax, the payor shall remit such withholding or similar tax to the appropriate government authority, deduct the amount paid from the amount due to payee and secure and send to payee the best available evidence of the payment of such withholding or similar tax.

Harpoon shall (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an exemption of such withheld amounts to the extent practicable under Applicable Law and (b) cooperate with AbbVie to obtain a reduction or refund of such withheld amounts.\n\n6.9 Indirect Taxes.

If any payment due to either Party under this Agreement is not paid when due, then such paying Party shall pay interest thereon (before and after any judgment) at [***] such interest to run from the date on which payment of such sum became due until payment thereof in full together with such interest; provided however that [***], then such interest [***], as adjusted from time to time on the [***].\n\n6.11 Audit.

Such examinations may not (a) be conducted for any [***] [***] (b) be conducted more than once in any [***] period or (c) be [***] (unless a previous audit revealed an underpayment with respect to such [***]).

Thereafter, AbbVie shall have the first right to seek an injunction or other remedies against such commercial marketing as permitted pursuant to Section 351(l)(8)(B) of the PHSA.\n\n7.3.5 Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate fully in any infringement action pursuant to this Section 7.3. Where a Party brings such an action in accordance with this Agreement, the other Party shall, where necessary, furnish a power of attorney solely for such purpose or shall join in, or be named as a necessary party to, such action. Unless otherwise set forth herein, the Party entitled to bring any patent infringement litigation in accordance with this Section 7.3 shall have the right to settle such claim; provided that neither Party shall have the right to settle any patent infringement litigation under this Section 7.3 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party. The Party commencing the litigation shall provide the other Party with copies of all pleadings and other documents filed with the court if doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law, and shall consider reasonable input from the other Party during the course of the proceedings.\n\n7.3.6 Recovery.

Subject to Section 11.2, AbbVie shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding with counsel of its choice at its own expense. The assumption of the defense of a claim that may be subject to Section 11.2 by either AbbVie or Harpoon shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that Harpoon is liable to indemnify any AbbVie Indemnitee in respect of such indemnity claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by Harpoon of any defenses it may assert against an AbbVie Indemnitee's claim for indemnification. Without limitation of the foregoing, if AbbVie finds it necessary or desirable to join Harpoon as a party to any such action, Harpoon shall, at AbbVie's expense, execute all papers and perform such acts as shall be reasonably required. If AbbVie elects (in a written communication submitted to Harpoon within a reasonable amount of time after notice of the alleged patent infringement) not to defend or control the defense of, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of, any such claim, suit, or proceeding, within such time periods so that Harpoon is not prejudiced by any delays, Harpoon may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense.

AbbVie may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that Harpoon shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If Harpoon elects not to defend or control the defense of such Harpoon Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then solely with respect to Product-Specific Patents included in the Harpoon Patents, and subject to Section 7.5.2(b), AbbVie may request to conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding at its own expense, with Harpoon's consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.\n\n(b) On and after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, AbbVie shall have the responsibility for and control over the defense of the validity, patentability and enforceability of Product-Specific Patents at AbbVie's sole cost and expense. Harpoon may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that AbbVie shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding.

The other Party may participate in any such claim, suit, or proceeding in the Territory related to the Joint Patents with counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided that the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time shall retain control of the defense in such claim, suit, or proceeding. If the Party who is prosecuting the Joint Patents at the relevant time elects not to defend or control the defense of the Joint Patents in a suit brought in the Territory, or otherwise fails to initiate and maintain the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, then the other Party may conduct and control the defense of any such claim, suit, or proceeding, at its own expense.\n\n7.5.4 Cooperation. Each Party shall assist and cooperate with the other Party as such other Party may reasonably request from time to time in connection with its activities set forth in this Section 7.5, including by being joined as a party plaintiff in such action or proceeding, providing access to relevant documents and other evidence, and making its employees available at reasonable business hours. In connection with any such defense or claim or counterclaim, the controlling Party shall consider in good faith any comments from the other Party and shall keep the other Party reasonably informed of any steps taken, and shall provide copies of all documents filed, in connection with such defense, claim, or counterclaim provided that doing so would not waive any privilege or violate any court order or Applicable Law. In connection with the activities set forth in this Section 7.5, each Party shall consult with the other as to the strategy for the defense of the Harpoon Patents and Joint Patents. Neither Party shall have the right to settle any claim, suit, or proceeding under this Section 7.5 in a manner that imposes any costs or liability on, or involves any admission by, the other Party, without the express written consent of such other Party.\n\n7.5.5 Relationship to Enforcement of Patents. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of any of the Harpoon Patents, AbbVie Patents, or Joint Patents that is raised in connection with or in response to an infringement action or a biosimilar litigation shall be controlled by the Party who controls that infringement action or biosimilar litigation, and such Party shall have the right to manage, resolve, settle or dispose any such challenge according to Section 7.3, provided that (a) with respect to any Harpoon Patents that are not Product- Specific Patents and are not involved in any biosimilar patent litigation, where AbbVie is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action, AbbVie shall not resolve, settle or dispose of such action or litigation in any way that would admit liability on the part of Harpoon, or materially impact the validity, scope or enforceability of such Harpoon Patent, without Harpoon's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (b) with respect to any Harpoon Patents for which Harpoon did not give its consent to include within a biosimilar litigation, and Harpoon is the controlling Party in connection with an infringement action involving such Patents, then Harpoon shall be the controlling Party in connection with the defense to any challenge of validity, enforceability or patentability of such Harpoon Patents, but shall reasonably consult with AbbVie in connection with any such defense, and shall consider in good faith AbbVie's reasonable comments in relation thereto.\n\n7.6 Product Trademarks. As between the Parties, AbbVie shall own all right, title, and interest to the Product Trademarks in the Territory, and shall be responsible for the registration, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement thereof.

Each Party shall be solely responsible for any remuneration that may be due such Party's inventors under any applicable inventor remuneration laws.\n\n7.9 Common Interest. All information exchanged between the Parties regarding the prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of Patents under this Article 7 will be deemed to be Confidential Information of the disclosing Party. In addition, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, with regard to such prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense, the interests of the Parties as collaborators and Harpoon and licensee are to, for their mutual benefit, obtain patent protection and plan patent defense against potential infringement activities by Third Parties, and as such, are aligned and are legal in nature. The Parties agree and acknowledge that they have not waived, and nothing in this Agreement constitutes a waiver of, any legal privilege concerning Patents under this Article 7, including privilege under the common interest doctrine and similar or related doctrines. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a Party has a good faith belief that any information required to be disclosed by such Party to the other Party under this Article 7 is protected by attorney-client privilege or any other applicable legal privilege or immunity, such Party shall not be required to disclose such information and the Parties shall in good faith cooperate to agree upon a procedure (which may include entering into a specific common interest agreement, disclosing such information on a \"for counsel eyes only\" basis or similar procedure) under which such information may be disclosed without waiving or breaching such privilege or immunity.\n\nARTICLE 8 PHARMACOVIGILANCE AND SAFETY\n\n8.1 Pharmacovigilance.

Notwithstanding the forgoing, if any adverse event safety data is received or otherwise generated by Harpoon following the License Option Exercise Closing Date and prior to the execution of such agreement, Harpoon shall, within [***] of receiving or otherwise generating such data, provide such data to AbbVie by email to: [***].\n\n8.2 Global Safety Database. Harpoon shall initially set up, hold and maintain (at its sole cost and expense) the global safety database for Licensed Compounds and Licensed Products with respect to safety data obtained in connection with the Initial Development Activities. Within [***] after the License Option Exercise Closing Date, Harpoon shall transfer to AbbVie, in an electronic format reasonably satisfactory to AbbVie, the complete contents of the safety database maintained by Harpoon pursuant to the immediately foregoing sentence, and thereafter AbbVie shall set up, hold, and maintain (at AbbVie's sole cost and expense) the global safety database for Licensed Compounds or Licensed Products.

All indemnification claims in respect of a Party, its Affiliates, or their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be made solely by such Party to this Agreement (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party shall give the indemnifying Party prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under this Article 11, but in no event shall the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses to the extent resulting from any delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent\n\n- 59 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthat the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time). The Indemnified Party shall furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims.\n\n11.4 Control of Defense.\n\n11.4.1 In General. Subject to the provisions of Sections 7.4 (if applicable), 7.5 and 7.6, at its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor shall it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim. Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 11.4.2, the indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim unless specifically requested in writing by the indemnifying Party. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for any Losses incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.\n\n11.4.2 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 11.4.1, any Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided that such employment shall be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof, and the assumption by the indemnifying Party of such expense, has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing, (b) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 11.4.1 (in which case the Indemnified Party shall control the defense), or (c) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under Applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles (in which case the Indemnifying Party shall control its defense and the Indemnified Party shall control the defense of the Indemnified Party).\n\n11.4.3 Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that shall not result in the Indemnified Party's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief, and as to which the indemnifying Party shall have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the indemnifying Party shall have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, shall deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4.1, the indemnifying Party shall have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss; provided that it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the indemnifying Party does not assume and conduct the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may defend against such Third Party Claim. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or dispose of, any Third Party Claim without\n\n- 60 -\n\nSource: HARPOON THERAPEUTICS, INC., 10-K, 3/12/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nthe prior written consent of the indemnifying Party. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement, compromise or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the indemnifying Party.\n\n11.4.4 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access [***] afforded to the indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnified Parties and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith, subject to refund if the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.4.5 Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any Third Party Claim shall be reimbursed on a [***] basis in arrears by the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.\n\n11.5 Special, Indirect, and Other Losses. EXCEPT (A) FOR FRAUD, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, (B) FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER [ARTICLE 9 OR SECTION 5.8], (C) AS PROVIDED UNDER [***] AND (D) TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO A THIRD PARTY AS PART OF A CLAIM FOR WHICH A PARTY PROVIDES INDEMNIFICATION UNDER THIS ARTICLE 11, NEITHER PARTY NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE USE OF THE LICENSED COMPOUNDS OR LICENSED PRODUCTS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n11.6 Insurance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, AbbVie may self-insure, in whole or in part, the insurance requirements described above.\n\nARTICLE 12 TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n12.1 Term.\n\n12.1.1 Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith, shall continue in force and effect until (a) the date of expiration of the last Royalty Term for the last Licensed Product, or (b) the expiration of the License Option Period and the failure of AbbVie to exercise the License Option (such period, the \"Term\").\n\n12.1.2 Effect of Expiration of the Term.

If, as a result of the application of such dispute resolution procedures, the Breaching Party is determined to be in material breach of one (1) or more of its material obligations under this Agreement (an \"Adverse Ruling\"), then if the Breaching Party fails to complete the actions specified by the Adverse Ruling to cure such material breach within [***] after such ruling, or if such compliance cannot be fully achieved within such [***] period and the Breaching Party has failed to commence diligent efforts to achieve full compliance as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible or as prescribed by the Arbitrator, then the Non-Breaching Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Breaching Party.\n\n12.2.2 Material Breach Related to Diligence in a Major Market.

Complete, unredacted copies of this exhibit have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of this Company's confidential treatment request.\n\nDistributor Agreement                              ---------------------\n\nThis Distributor Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is made effective as of the 31st day of March, 2000 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between Airspan Networks Incorporated, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington having its principal office at 777 108th Avenue NE, Suite 1895, Bellevue, Washington 98004 (\"Airspan\") and GLS LLC, (\"Distributor\") a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the State of South Dakota having its principal office at 501 Fourth Street, Sergeant Bluff, IA 51054.\n\nWITNESSETH:\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan is engaged in the design and manufacture of various telecommunications product lines, including, among others, those product lines more completely described in Schedule I hereto (the product lines described in Schedule I, as from time to time amended in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, are hereinafter called the \"Airspan Products\") the hardware components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Equipment,\" the software components thereof are sometimes referred to separately as \"Software\" as defined in Section 11.1, and an arrangement of Equipment which, when interfaced with Software, is operable to perform predetermined functions, is referred to as a \"System\");\n\nWHEREAS, Distributor is engaged in the promotion of sales of telecommunications products; and\n\nWHEREAS, Airspan desires to appoint Distributor as a Distributor for the Airspan Products for the territory described in Schedule II hereto (the \"Territory\").\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, it is hereby agreed as follows:\n\n1.   APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.  During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three (3) months following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees that neither it nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products, nor will Distributor market or otherwise promote the sale of such products. Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.\n\nDistributor hereby represents and warrants as follows:\n\na.   Distributor has been duly registered in accordance with any and all relevant legislation, has received any and all necessary governmental authorizations to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and that its entry into and performance under this Agreement will not violate applicable legislation;\n\nb.   Distributor is duly registered with all necessary tax authorities and is in compliance with all payment obligations in accordance with applicable legislation.  No claims against or investigations of Distributor with respect to its tax obligations exist;\n\nc.   Distributor is not currently involved in any litigation, arbitration, or other legal proceedings in which claims are being asserted against Distributor which might affect its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, nor is Distributor aware of any unasserted claims against Distributor of this nature; and\n\nd.   Distributor's bank accounts have been established and operated in accordance with applicable legislation.  All transactions of Distributor required to be carried out through authorized banks have been so carried out. Distributor is not, has not, and warrants that it will not breach any currency regulation or currency control legislation.

Distributor will conduct or provide for      any training of its personnel which may be necessary to impart such      knowledge.\n\n3.5  Distributor and its staff will research the technical requirements and      specifications of the market for Airspan Products in the Territory and make      information known to Airspan such that Airspan may, at its discretion,      implement appropriate technical changes to the Products to enable them to      be sold in the Territory. Airspan acknowledges that, subject to a further      and separate Agreement, such changes may be implemented in the future by      Distributor, with the assistance of Airspan.\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 4\n\n3.6  Distributor agrees to purchase and stock a comprehensive inventory of      spare parts based upon the recommended list set forth in Schedule III to      this Agreement.\n\n3.7  Distributor agrees to provide to its customers' installation services      for all Airspan Products.  All such installation services shall be      performed by Distributor in accordance with Airspan's latest installation      standards as provided by Airspan.\n\n3.8  Distributor agrees to train and have readily available a maintenance      staff to efficiently and expeditiously maintain or upgrade all Airspan      Products purchased or licensed by Distributor from Airspan.  Maintenance      shall be performed in accordance with Airspan's latest maintenance      standards for Airspan Products, as provided by Airspan, by Distributor's      own personnel and may not be subcontracted or delegated to any other person      or entity without Airspan's prior, written authorization.\n\n3.9  Distributor agrees to provide and maintain those facilities adequate      to meet the obligations set forth in this section and of the Agreement.      Distributor further agrees to provide all of the sales and support      functions set forth in this section at no charge to Airspan.\n\n3.10 Distributor agrees not to actively seek to promote, rent, lease, sell,      sublicense or authorize the rental, sale or sublicense of Airspan Products      outside of the Territory [without the prior written approval of Airspan],      but nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Distributor from renting,      selling or sublicensing the Airspan Products to customers outside of the      Territory in response to an unsolicited request from such customer.\n\n3.11 During the term of this Agreement Distributor agrees that neither it      nor any organization or entity controlled or directed by it will, without      Airspan's prior, written consent, represent a manufacturer or supplier of      products similar in design or performance to or which are of such a nature      as to be competitive with any products contained in the Airspan Products.\n\n3.12 The parties mutually agree that by April 30, 2000, the parties will      negotiate and execute a National Accounts Consulting Agreement whereby the      Distributor will receive consulting fees and commissions for the sale and      deployment of Airspan's products on a national basis. It is the intent of      the parties to jointly pursue the sale of products to said companies and to      enter into and complete contracts for the deployment of products in this      manner.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 5\n\n4.

Each Purchase Order shall specifically incorporate by reference the      terms and conditions of this Agreement, and no additional or different      terms and conditions stated in a Purchase Order, any letter, or otherwise\n\n\n\n\n\nshall be binding unless expressly referred and agreed to by Airspan in      writing. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of      this Agreement and of any Purchase Order issued hereunder, or if the      Purchase Order does not reference the terms and conditions of this      Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.\n\n4.2  If a Purchase Order is accepted by Airspan, Airspan will issue an      order acknowledgment to Distributor within five (5) business days of      Airspan's receipt of the written Purchase Order from Distributor.\n\n5.

PAYMENT TERMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1  Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in      accordance with the payment terms below. The Invoice specifically will      identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract      Price of such items.  Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right      of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.\n\n7.2  If Distributor disputes any invoice or part thereof, Distributor      must notify Airspan in writing within twenty-five (25) days of the invoice      date giving details of the reason for such dispute.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 8\n\nDistributor and Airspan agree to work together in good faith to resolve the      dispute as quickly as possible. Distributor may withhold payment of such      disputed amounts until resolution of the dispute. Any parts of the invoice      not under dispute shall be paid net forty-five (45) days after the date of      invoice. On resolution of the dispute, Distributor shall immediately pay      any amounts due in full.\n\n7.3  Distributor will make payment by wire or telegraphic transfer to      the bank account set forth below or, on receipt of written notification      from Airspan, to another designated bank within the United States.\n\nBank:            Seafirst Bank, 10555 N.E. 8th, Bellevue, WA98004, USA.      Account name:    Airspan Networks Inc.      Account number:  68777507      Routing Number:  125 - 0000 - 24      Further instructions: \"Reference (Distributor's name), Purchase Order      number, Payment of Invoice number\"\n\nPayment will be deemed to have been made upon receipt of funds in Airspan's      bank.\n\n7.4  If the cost to Airspan of performing this Agreement increases as a      result of any change to the law or increase in import duty or freight duty,      Airspan may, at any time, add such increase to the Contract Price by      notifying Distributor in writing of such increase.\n\n8.   DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS.\n\n8.1  All Equipment and Software will be delivered by Airspan CIP (as      defined in Incoterms 2000) to an airport in South Dakota that completes      international customs clearances and shipped to a location within the city      limits of the above arrival airport, such airport and delivery location are      to be agreed upon in writing by the parties for each Purchase Order.      Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and      insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits. If      requested by Distributor, Airspan may arrange for shipment to be made to      Distributor's identified warehouse facilities or freight forwarder outside      of the city limits, subject to approval in writing by Airspan and agreement      to any additional charges in advance of shipment.  Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor. The warranty period for any item of Equipment and related Software shall be twelve (12) months from the date of delivery of such Equipment and related Software to Distributor as set forth in Paragraph 8.1 (hereinafter, this period of time shall be referred to as the \"Initial Warranty Period.\")\n\n14.3 Airspan's obligation and Distributor's sole remedy under this warranty are limited to the replacement or repair, at Airspan's option, of the defective Equipment or Software within the Initial Warranty Period. Airspan shall have no obligation to remedy any such defect if it can be shown that: (a) the Equipment or Software was altered, repaired, or reworked by any party other than Airspan without Airspan's prior written consent; (b) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's improper storage, mishandling, abuse, or misuse of the Equipment or Software; (c) such defects were the result of Distributor's or a third party's use of the Equipment or Software in conjunction with equipment electronically or mechanically incompatible or of an inferior quality; or (d) the defect was the result of damage by fire, explosion, power failure, or any act of nature.\n\n14.4  In no event shall Airspan be obliged to provide on-site maintenance. Subject to the provisions of this warranty clause, defective parts or components must be returned by Distributor to Airspan's designated facility located within the contiguous 48 states in the United States, freight prepaid, within the Initial Warranty Period, and said defective parts will be repaired or replaced by Airspan at no charge to Distributor.  In connection with such return by Distributor, Distributor shall comply with Airspan's Return Material Authorization (RMA) procedures.  Risk of loss or damage to Equipment or Software returned to Airspan for repair or replacement shall be borne by Distributor until delivery to Airspan.  Upon delivery of such Equipment or Software, Airspan shall assume the risk of loss or damage until that time that the Equipment or Software being repaired or replaced is returned and delivered to Distributor. Distributor will pay all transportation costs for Equipment or Software shipped to Airspan for repair or replacement.  Airspan shall pay all transportation costs associated\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 18\n\nwith returning repaired or replaced Equipment or Software to Distributor unless there was no fault found (NFF), in which event, the Distributor shall pay such transportation costs, along with Airspan's then prevailing standard NFF charge.\n\n14.5  Airspan will charge Distributor for any maintenance carried out which is not covered by the warranties contained in Section 14.2 or Section 15 at Airspan's then prevailing standard rates for such services.\n\n15.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n16.1  WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SECTION 16.4, NEITHER Airspan, NOR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, SHAREHOLDERS, OR AFFILIATES (Airspan AND SUCH OTHER PERSONS, THE \"Airspan PARTIES\"), SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO DISTRIBUTOR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, REVENUE OR DATA, OR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PURCHASE ORDER PLACED PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER COLLATERAL CONTRACT, OR FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE THEREOF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THEM EITHER SEPARATELY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE, OR FROM ANY OTHER CAUSE, WHETHER CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY, ON GROUNDS OF FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR OTHERWISE.\n\n16.2  Without prejudice to Sections 16.3 and 16.4, the liability of the Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, for each event or series of connected events\n\n\n\n\n\narising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any purchase order placed pursuant to this Agreement, or any other collateral contract, or from or in connection with the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other cause, whether caused by negligence, breach of contract, strict liability, breach of warranty, on grounds of failure of essential purpose, or otherwise, shall in no circumstance exceed the total amount payable by Distributor to Airspan under this Agreement for the provision of\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 19\n\nthe Equipment or Software which gave rise to the loss or damage or in connection with which the loss or damage was incurred.\n\n16.3  Airspan Parties, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Distributor's property resulting from Airspan's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).  And Distributor, taken as a whole, shall be liable for physical damage to Airspan's property resulting from Distributor's negligence under or in connection with this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of one million US Dollars (US$1,000,000).\n\n16.4  Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or in any way limit Airspan liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\n\n16.5  Save as provided for in Section 17 Distributor shall indemnify and hold harmless and defend the Airspan Parties from and against all claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, writs, judgments, orders and decrees brought, made or rendered against them or any of them and all damages, losses and expenses suffered or incurred by them or any of them howsoever arising out of or related to the breach by Distributor of any of the terms of this Agreement. Airspan shall notify Distributor forthwith of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, writ, judgment, order or decree falling within the scope of this Section 16.5 and shall permit Distributor sole conduct of the same and shall provide reasonable assistance in relation thereto, subject to appropriate defense by Distributor and the payment by Distributor of Airspan's reasonable costs and expenses.\n\n16.6  Distributor shall include, in its agreements with its customers pursuant to which Distributor supplies Equipment or Software, provisions pursuant to which such customers agree that the Airspan Parties shall have no liability for any of the types of damages referred to at Section 16.1 in connection with or arising from the Equipment or Software or the use thereof, or the inability to use them either separately or in combination with other equipment or software, or from any other causes.\n\n17.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY.\n\n17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information.

CLAUSE 14 VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY     14.1 The Regulations of Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as annex 1 (MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION  OF QUALITY FOR THE MIX OF CRUDE OILS).     14.2 Each of the Senders shall deliver to the Transporter at a Point of Entrance a Hydrocarbon volume which, and only for purposes of Volumetric  Compensation for Quality (CVC), shall be valued according to the procedure defined for the Pipeline and in accordance with its particular quality.  This quality shall be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the  Sender.     14.3 Considering that as a result of the Transportation the Hydrocarbons delivered in the Pipeline are mixed without distinction, each Sender shall  withdraw at the Point of Exit a volume of Hydrocarbons with a different quality than its Hydrocarbon delivered, except when it has been requested  and has been accepted the Transportation of Hydrocarbons in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated Hydrocarbon shall also be  determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the Senders. This  Hydrocarbon shall be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation for Quality and shall take into account the compensation for  quality due to the interfaces occurring when transported with other Crude Oils.     14.4 The Transporter shall apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality defined by the same for the Pipeline which shall have the  following main characteristics:     14.4.1 The Senders who have delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a better quality than the mixed Hydrocarbon withdrawn at the Point  of Exit of the Pipeline shall be entitled to compensation in volume, equivalent to the volumes that Senders who have delivered Hydrocarbons of  lower quality than the ones withdrawn at the Point of Exit will have to assume. For such purpose, individual qualities of all volumes delivered and  withdrawn shall be taken into account as well as the final inventories of the preceding month of Operation and the last month of Operation, with its  respective qualities.\n\n\n\n  25\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    14.4.2 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be internal between the Senders in such a way that the final volumetric balances equal cero  and the Transporter shall neither charge nor Pay any volume for this purpose and shall only serve as a mediator, regulator, liquidator and  responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations.     14.4.3 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Rate and therefore shall not be compensated or will have any variation as a result  of this.     14.5 In each month of Operation the Transporter shall make a balance of the existing volumes and qualities at the beginning of the month delivered  to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn and existing at the end of the month, both for the total of Hydrocarbons as well as for individual Hydrocarbons of  each Sender.     14.6 The Sender shall hold the Transporter and owner harmless against any cost, action, claim, intended procedures by any Third parties, losses  and all damage and obligations incurred and inherent to the mix of Hydrocarbons in the Transportation process and the Volumetric Compensation  for Quality.     14.7 In any case the Transporter may modify the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality contained herein, in the respective annexes  and all other documents in connection with the CVC.     14.8 Senders of a specific Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter not to apply the Volumetric Compensation for Quality to said  Hydrocarbon. The foregoing shall be applicable as long as the Hydrocarbon of other Senders is not affected negatively.     14.9 By agreement between the totality of Senders and the Transporter, it may be decided not to implement the Volumetric Compensation for  Quality (CVC) for Crude Oils transported through the system. In this case the Transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the  Senders to carry out the volumetric balances.     CLAUSE 15 BULLETIN OF TRANSORTATION BY THE PIPELINE - BTO     15.1 The Transporter shall implement the Bulletin of Transportation by the Pipeline - BTO - which shall contain as a minimum the following  information:     15.2 Information of public access:     15.2.1 General description of the Pipeline     15.2.2 Current rates for each Distance     15.2.3 Value tables or current calculation formulas of Monetary Conditions     15.2.4 Design Capacity of the Pipeline and Nominal Capacity\n\n\n\n  26\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.2.5 Monthly available Capacity of the Pipeline estimated for the next (6) months and annual for the next five (5) years.     15.2.6 Excerpts of this Manual corresponding to connection requests, nomination process and minimum quality requirements of Crude Oil     15.3 Information of exclusive access for Senders and Third parties:     15.3.1 This valid Manual.     15.3.2 Discussion on modifications to the Manual     15.3.3 General information on the programmed maintenance schedule of the Pipeline and other programed activities affecting the effective Capacity  during the next six (6) months.     15.3.4 Listing of expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline's infrastructure     15.3.5 Effective Capacity confirmed for each month of Operation and estimated for the following five (5) months and the corresponding available  Capacity for each Distance.     15.3.6 Transportation program for the month of Operation and tentative for the following (5) months for each Distance     15.3.7 Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and foreseen in the nomination process to assign the available Capacity  equitably     15.3.8 Last volumetric balance prepared for the Pipeline.     15.3.9 Daily statistics for the last month of Operation and monthly statistics since the enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the Ministry  of Mines and Energy on the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances.     15.3.10 The annual rates and the Monetary Conditions for each Distance from the date of enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the  Ministry of Mines and Energy.     15.4 The Transporter is no obliged to publish any information of reserved character.     15.5 The Transporter shall provide to Senders and any Third parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline as requested,  within the following ten (10) calendar days after the request and with previous verification from the Transporter of their Capacity as Sender or  Third Party an access password to the information of exclusive character referred to in numeral 15.3 of this clause.

If the Transporter exercises its right of sale pursuant to this clause, the Transporter shall deduct  from the proceeds of such sale all costs incurred by the Transporter with respect to the storage, removal and sale of such Crude Oil. The  Transporter shall pay the balance to the Sender.\n\n\n\n  28\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    16.1.7 The Transporter shall not accept Crude Oil delivered by any Sender if this may cause impairment to the Pipeline of the Crudes or mixtures  transported (without consideration of whether or not the Crude Oil meets the minimum quality specifications).     16.1.8 The Transporter acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be entitled to make any changes to the minimum quality specifications of Crude  Oil in accordance with operating practices, which may be necessary or pertinent, including but without being limited to, prevent material damage or  the material degradation of the effective Capacity of the Pipeline in order to prevent any personal injuries or damage to the property or the  environment.     CLAUSE 17 REGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON     17.1 With a previous request from the Sender or Third Party, the Transporter may accept the Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon to the  extent that this is a technical and economically viable alternative. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme set  out in clause 10 and shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions in this Manual.     17.2 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter shall inform the Sender its disposition to start the Transportation of segregated  Hydrocarbon. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be subject to the nomination process set forth in this Manual.     17.3 Any additional charges for Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be borne by the Sender or Third Party requesting the service, and  it will be taken into account, including but without being limited, any costs and damage caused to the Transporter, owner or other Senders.     CLAUSE 18 RISKS AND RESPONSIBILITY     18.1 The Transporter shall exercise custody on the Hydrocarbon from the time the Sender or whoever the Sender designates, delivers it at the Point  of Entrance and until the Point of Exit.     18.2 Neither the Transporter nor the owner shall be responsible for the consequences of failing to comply with the deliveries and withdrawals  generated by the Sender in the Transportation program, commitments of operators and/or Transporters of Transportation systems connected to  the Pipeline.\n\n\n\n  29\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.3 The Transporter shall not be responsible for any damage or deterioration that a Hydrocarbon delivered by a Sender may suffer, such as  contamination with strange materials, contamination by contact of different types of Hydrocarbons if the damage or deterioration is due to  Justified Events. In the event any of the cases previously mentioned occurs, and one or more Senders are involved, all the Hydrocarbons affected  shall be prorated between the Senders in proportion to the ownership of each of the Hydrocarbons involved, without prejudice of any indemnities  afterwards which may be applicable between the Senders affected. The Transporter shall prepare the information corresponding to the volume of  Hydrocarbon affected and the proportion corresponding to each Sender.     18.4 The Transporter shall be responsible for the Transportation service, for any losses, damage or deterioration that the Hydrocarbon may suffer.  The Transporter shall be released from any responsibility in the Justified Events and the Transporter is not incurring in any gross negligence.     18.5 Any damage or prejudice caused to the Transporter by virtue of failing to comply with the regulations contained in this Manual by any  Sender shall be the responsibility of the Sender who shall indemnify the Transporter for such damage or prejudice.     18.6 Hydrocarbons delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in their quality as a result of the mix with other  Hydrocarbons. Except for events in which segregated Hydrocarbons are transported, the Transporter shall not have any obligation to return at the  Point of Exit a Hydrocarbon of the same quality as the Hydrocarbon delivered for its Transportation at the Point of Entrance. The adjustments of  Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be applied to the transported mixed Hydrocarbons.     18.7 In the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline, contamination fronts are generated. All Senders  of the Pipeline shall accept as withdrawn volume, a portion of the contamination fronts generated in the Transportation through the Pipeline. If the  Sender requires some special conditions for the Transportation of a Hydrocarbon, these shall be agreed with the Transporter who reserves the  right to accept them and require the Sender to bear all costs associated to such conditions.     18.8 The following shall be considered in the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline:     18.8.1 The Hydrocarbon of higher quality with respect to the Hydrocarbon of lower quality shall always be degraded in the contamination fronts.\n\n\n\n  30\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.8.2 The Transporter shall estimate a maximum volume corresponding to the contamination fronts and shall be responsible to comply with this  value.     18.9 The Transporter is obliged to return the Sender and the latter to withdraw at a Point of Exit, the volume of equivalent Hydrocarbon upon  application of the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     18.10 The Senders and Third parties shall indemnify and hold the Transporter and the owner harmless against any costs, claims, litigations, judicial  or extra-judicial action, and decisions of any kind, which may be brought against the Transporter or owner, and in general by any procedure  intended by any Third parties.     CLAUSE 19 FILLING THE PIPELINE OR FILLING THE LINE     19.1 It is the necessary volume to fill the Pipeline between the initial pumping station and the final station, the non-pumping bottom of the storage  tanks of the Pipeline, and all installations, tubes, equipment, pumping and measuring accessories.     19.2 For the Pipeline Operation, the Transporter may request to each Sender, including the ANH, to deliver to the Transporter the necessary  quantity of Hydrocarbon to fill in the line of the Pipeline. The participation of each Sender in filling in the line shall be determined by the  Transporter based on criteria such as: Ownership of the Pipeline and Contracted Capacity.     19.3 The Transporter shall determine at its judgment the Day in which each Sender shall deliver its proportional participation in filling the line of  the Pipeline, and shall communicate the corresponding volume indicating the date of delivery.     19.4 The Hydrocarbon delivered by the Senders to fill in the line of the Pipeline shall not be withdrawn from the Pipeline without the previous  authorization from the Transporter. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall not lose the ownership of the Hydrocarbon remaining in  the Pipeline.     19.5 When segregated Hydrocarbon is transported, it shall be understood that the ownership of the filling of the line of the Pipeline varies  according to the volumes of segregated Hydrocarbon present in the Pipeline at a given time. Without prejudice of the foregoing, the Sender shall  not lose the ownership of the segregated Hydrocarbon remaining in the Pipeline.     CLAUSE 20 HANDLING LOSSES IN THE PIPELINE     20.1 The identification and handling of losses in the Pipeline shall be carried out as follows:\n\n\n\n  31\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.1 All identifiable losses of mix or segregated Hydrocarbon not attributable to the Transporter as per numeral 18.4 shall be assumed by the  Senders of the mix or segregated Hydrocarbon according to the calculation made by the Transporter based on the Operational parameters and  formalized in the CVC. In this sense, the Senders accept the liquidation made by the Transporter.     20.1.2 The report prepared by the Transporter shall be considered as the basis to calculate the identifiable losses, indicating the Operation  conditions of that day, time, place, causes, deliveries, dispatches, withdrawals, mix or segregated Hydrocarbon, recovered and lost and determined  after the filling of the line and the restarting of the pumping.     20.1.3 Non-identifiable loses are understood only those losses during Transportation to which its cause cannot be determined with precision  throughout the process, from the Points of Entrance to the Points of Exit, including but without being limited to the following:\n\n   20.1.4 The Transporter shall calculate these losses each semester in such a manner that the semester calculation reflects the real losses occurring  during each semester. The average semester of all losses shall be up to cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries of the period. This  calculation shall be made by means of balances that the Transporter shall carry out at the beginning of each calendar month with respect to the  previous calendar month, which shall reflect the deliveries and withdrawals, the inventory movement and the identifiable losses, if there are any, to  be calculated each semester.     20.1.5 In the case of mix Hydrocarbon, the Non-identifiable Losses of the semester shall be assumed by each of the Senders at prorate of the  deliveries of the period.\n\n\n\n  \u00b7 Stops/ starts of the Pipeline    \u00b7 Illegal extractions non-detected    \u00b7 Faults in the meter factors    \u00b7 Volumetric contractions    \u00b7 Leakages/passes in the valves    \u00b7 Evaporation    \u00b7 Escapes    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties on the measurement systems and associated instrumentation    \u00b7 Inherent uncertainties of laboratory analysis associated to the calculation of volumes    \u00b7 Propagation of inherent uncertainties of the procedures set out at the international level for the calculation of volumes by static and  dynamic measurement.    \u00b7 Handling loses inherent to the Pipeline\n\n  32\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    20.1.6 In the case of segregated Hydrocarbon, the Sender of the segregated Hydrocarbon shall assume the Non-identifiable losses of the semester.     20.1.7 In the event that Non-identifiable losses exceed cero Point five percent (0.5%) of the deliveries, calculated each semester, the Transporter  shall inquire on the possible causes in order to take the corrective actions immediately.     20.1.8 The calculation procedure of losses in the Pipeline shall be governed by the provisions in this clause and the current Compensation  Mechanism for Quality for the Mix of Crude Oil.     20.1.9 Non-identifiable losses equal or less than 0.5% monthly shall be distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each  Sender of the calendar month in which they were detected or the calendar month in which they are reported.     20.1.10 Identifiable losses are distributed according to the value in US dollars of the deliveries by each Sender on the calendar month in which they  were detected     CLAUSE 21 CLAIMS     21.1 Any claim by a Sender or Third Party in connection with the Transportation service of Hydrocarbons shall be resolved pursuant to the  internal procedures of the Transporter and the applicable regulations. These claims shall be delivered to the Transporter's Operational area and  they shall conduct the respective internal procedure and shall communicate the result to the Sender.     21.2 For claims regarding the quantity or quality of Hydrocarbons, these shall be presented in writing at the latest within fifteen (15) calendar days  after the date of delivery or withdrawal of the Hydrocarbon or the date in which the report for the Volumetric Compensation for Quality is issued.

CLAUSE 27 SETTLEMENT OF CONTROVERSIES     27.1 In the event of occurrence of any conflict or disagreement in connection with the Manual hereof or the Transportation service, it shall be  initially resolved by a representative duly authorized from each of the parties within thirty (30) days following the notification issued by the Party  who considers the existence of a disagreement and effectively received by the other Party.     27.2 If, after the thirty (30) days abovementioned, the disagreement continues totally or partially, the parties shall rely on any alternative  mechanism to settle conflicts contained in the Colombian legislation.     CLAUSE 28 VALIDITY     28.1 The validity of this Manual is the date of its disclosure which shall be made through a publication in the Transporter's website.     CLAUSE 29 ADDITIONS AND MODIFICATION     29.1 The Transporter may carry out additions or modifications to this Manual, pursuant to the provisions in Resolution 18-1258 of July 14, 2010  from the Ministry of Mines and Energy as substituted or amended.     CLAUSE 30 APPLICABLE LEGISLATION     30.1 This Manual is governed in all its parts by the applicable regulations of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n\n  39\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   ANNEX 1: MECHANISMS OF QUALITY COMPENSATION FOR THE MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL     ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES OR VOLUMETRIC BALANCES     The Transporter shall conduct the volumetric balance with a monthly frequency in order to establish the volumes injected by each Sender to the  Pipeline, the identifiable losses, the Non-identifiable losses, consumptions, inventory variations, and any adjustments for quality if the latter is  applicable.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions set out in the Manual of the Transporter for handling Losses in the Pipeline and in the annex  hereof shall be applied.\n\n   The Transporter assumes the totality of costs for consumption of Crude Oil.\n\n\n\n   In order to make equitable adjustments between the Senders of the Pipeline by the differences in value resulting for differences in  quality of Crude Oils delivered I the Pipeline, a procedure of volumetric compensation for quality shall be established (\"CVC\"  in  Spanish).     The purpose of the CVC is to establish a system to compensate Senders for the degradation or improvement of the Crude Oil withdrawn  compared with the Crude delivered. The Sender withdrawing a Crude o lower quality than the Crude delivered shall be compensated  with a higher volume. The Sender withdrawing a Crude with higher quality than the Crude delivered shall compensate others Senders of  better quality accepting a lower volume. At any rate, the sum of debits and credits by CVC for all Senders shall be cero.\n\n\n\n  1. LOSSES\n\n  2. CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION\n\n  3. VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY - CVC\n\n  3.1 When Crude Oils are delivered to the Pipeline of different quality and from different Senders, the result shall be a Crude Oil with  different characteristics of quality and market value than the Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline by each of the Senders. Due to different  qualities of Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline, some Senders shall withdraw Crude of higher value than the Oil delivered while others  shall withdraw Crude Oil with less value than the Oil delivered to the Pipeline.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    At any node of Entrance of the Pipeline where two or more Crude Oil flows merge in order to be transported, a volumetric compensation  for quality shall be established on the resulting mix.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions in the Manual of the Transporter shall be applied for measurements in the  Pipeline.\n\n   The Transporter set out detailed procedures for the CVC following the guidelines established hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   For any month of Operation the corresponding quantity of Crude of each Sender shall be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.2 SAMPLING AND SYSTEM MEASUREMENT\n\n  3.3 CVC PROCEDURES\n\n  3.3.1 The Transporter shall administer the CVC process and the Senders may audit the process or request reviews thereto as long as the  Transporter is timely informed and a working plan is coordinated between the parties.\n\n  3.3.2 The Transporter shall establish monthly the coefficients for adjustments of quality and sulfur pursuant to the criteria established  herein.\n\n  3.3.3 The CVC shall be settled in kind.\n\n  3.3.4 The Transporter shall make monthly adjustments to the corresponding volume of Crude to each Sender, based on the coefficients of  adjustment for quality.\n\n  (a) Reduced if such Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of lower quality than the average quality of the mix,\n\n  (b) Increased if said Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of ah higher quality than the average quality of the mix.\n\n  3.3.5 At the latest on the 15th day of the calendar month following the Operation, Senders shall report to the Transporter the export prices,  the API gravity and the sulfur content of its Crude for the Month of Operation.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The parties may jointly review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The API gravity and the sulfur content on the data base of the Crude quality are representative of the current qualities of Crude  which is being delivered.     The variability of the API gravity and sulfur is within an allowed tolerance to be determined by the parties. Analyses of sulfur  content shall be conducted based on a schedule agreed by the parties after the beginning of the Fiscal Year.\n\n   By means of using the Crude Oil basket of reference the variation of price shall be determined regarding the API grade and sulfur content for Crude  Oil delivered. The method is based on the use of the linear regression of prices of a Crude Oil basket of reference delivered in the coast of the Gulf  of The United States of America with API gravity and sulfur content.\n\n\n\n  3.3.6 Each month of Operation the Transporter shall measure the volumes delivered by the Senders and shall determine the weighted  average for the quality parameters of Crude Oils delivered.\n\n  3.3.7 The Transporter shall calculate the adjustments to the volume for each Sender and shall determine the Crude volume that  corresponds. No adjustment in the volume as a consequence of the CVC shall affect the Transportation fee that a Sender shall Pay to  the Transporter.\n\n  3.3.8 Senders acknowledge that adjustments to their Crude volumes to be withdrawn as a result of these principles and procedures of the  CVC may affect the volume of Crude Oil for a withdrawal afterwards.\n\n  3.3.9 Senders are entitled to review the Transporter's calculations regarding the adjustments by CVC and the due application of this  procedure.\n\n  (a) The appropriateness of the Crude Oil reference basket regarding their terms of quality.\n\n  (b) The information on prices available to the public.\n\n  (c) The calculations of the coefficients and the volumes adjusted.\n\n  3.3.10 A data base for the API gravity shall be developed and sulfur content for Crude delivered from reliable samples of laboratory of  Crude Oil flows. The quality data of Crude Oil must comply with the following criteria:\n\n  3.4 METHODOLOGY FOR CRUDE OIL VALUATION\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n   The basket of Crude Oil to be used shall always include a minimum of ten (10) Crude Oils. The basket of reference for Crude Oil with prices and  qualities historically recognized shall be used to determine the coefficients of adjustment for API grade and sulfur content. The price information  of the basket shall be continuously available from sources open to the public for each Crude Oil of reference. Prices reported used in the basket of  Crude Oil of reference shall be obtained from independent price information services recognized by the industry and shall come from real  Operations.     This basket provides a range of qualities to develop the coefficients for the regressions and therefore cover the flows that may be injected to the  Pipeline. The initial basket of Crude Oils to be used is the one established in table I of this procedure which may be reviewed by common  agreement between the Transporter and the Senders.\n\n   All price quotes of Crude Oil for a common location in the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America shall be adjusted.     All prices of Crude Oil of reference shall be adjusted with respect to the location and based on the availability of price information according to the  following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tables II to IV of this procedure show examples for calculation of basket Crude prices delivered in the Gulf Coast.\n\n   To determine API gravity and sulfur coefficients linear regressions shall be run using the minimum square method.\n\n\n\n  3.4.1 BASKET OF REFERENCE FOR CRUDE OIL\n\n  3.4.2 CALCULATION OF CRUDE OIL PRICES FOR THE BASKET IN THE COAST OF THE GULF\n\n  1. FOB quotation\n\n  - Transportation to the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America is added using the appropriate vessel size.\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  2. CIF quotation\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  3. Crude Oil delivered by the Pipeline\n\n  - Any Pipeline fee is added if necessary\n\n  - \"Superfund\" is included and other fees/tariffs as appropriate.\n\n  3.4.3 LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PRICES, GRAVITY AND SULFUR\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    First the arithmetic average is calculated for prices of the basket of Crude Oils of reference delivered in the Gulf coast for three months. The  cumulative average for three months shall be calculated at the closing of the settling month using the prices for the settling month and the two (2)  previous months prior to the settling month (See 1 in table V).     To determine the API gravity coefficient, a linear regression analysis shall be performed using the three months average of Crude prices from the  basket calculated in the paragraph above as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 2 in table V).     To determine the sulfur content a linear regression analysis shall be conducted using the three month average of Crude prices from the basket  calculated in the previous paragraph as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 3 in table V).     The results of the determination of the linear relation between the price delivered and the API gravity and sulfur content may be stated in the  following lineal equation:     Y = A1* X1+ B* X2 + b     Pr = A1* APIR+ B*SR + b (1)     Where:     PR = Crude price in $/Bbl     A1 = API gravity coefficient determined through linear regression in $ by grade API-Bbl     APIR = Independent variable of API gravity     B = Sulfur coefficient determined through linear regression in $/%S-Bbl (negative number)     SR = Independent variable of sulfur content     b = Y interception determined from the linear regression in $/Bbl.\n\n   After obtaining the API and sulfur coefficients, a volumetric adjustment shall be calculated to conciliate differences between the quality of each  Sender and the mix transported. The quantity to be adjusted for each Sender is determined as is follows:\n\n\n\n  3.4.3 ADJSUTMENT OF VOLUMES FOR SENDERS (TABLE VI)\n\n  44\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    The relative value of Crude Oil for each Sender shall be calculated at the Point of Entrance. To obtain this, the API gravity of Crude from each  Sender is multiplied by the API coefficient obtained in the regression and then adding to this result, the multiplication of the sulfur percentage of  Crude from each Sender by the sulfur coefficient obtained in the regression. See table VI in the column - Relative value of Crude $/BBL     The relative value of the mix transported is calculated with the data of the relative value of each Crude Oil from all Senders. This value is obtained  calculating the weighted average of the relative values of each Crude Oil multiplied by the volume delivered by the Sender. (See (1) table VI     After this, the average export price of the mix must be obtained with the data from exports of all Senders in the month in which the adjustments are  made. (See (2) in table VI     To obtain the calculated price, the difference between the relative value of each Crude Oil and the relative value calculated for mix (1) must be  obtained, and add this difference to the average export price of the mix.     Then, the quantity delivered by the Sender is multiplied by its calculated price and this product is divided between the average export price of the  mix, obtaining as a result the total adjusted volume by Sender.     The volume to be adjusted shall be the difference between the total adjusted volume by Sender and the volume delivered by a Sender to the  Pipeline.     The sum of volumes to be adjusted from all Senders must be cero.     The Transporter shall run the linear regression using a spreadsheet such as Excel. The Transporter shall document the statistical results of the  linear regression so that the information can be provided to any Sender upon request.\n\n\n\n  45\n\n\n\n\n\n  Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   Table I     Reference Crude Basket\n\n   Table II     Illegible Information     Table III     Illegible Information     Table IV     Illegible Information\n\n\n\nDegree Origin API, \u00b0 Sulfur% Source for   Pricing  BBL/MT\n\nArab Light Saudi Arabia 33.2 1.9 Argus, Formula 7.34  Arab Medium Saudi Arabia 30.5 2.4 Argus, Formula 7.22  Arab Heavy Saudi Arabia 27.6 2.8 Argus, Formula 7.09  Castilla Colombia 18.8 2.0 Platts 6.70  LLS US Gulf Coast 36.2 0.3 Argus 7.47  Mars US Gulf Coast 28.0 2.1 Argus 7.15  Maya Mexico 21.1 3.5 Argus 6.80  Napo Ecuador 18.0 2.3 Platts 6.66  East Ecuador 24.0 1.2 Platts 6.93  Vasconia Colombia 26.5 0.9 Platts 7.04\n\n  46\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    Table V     Linear regression of prices, API gravity and sulfur - August 2010 Closing Example\n\n\n\n   Table VI     Adjustments of volumes for senders - August 2010 example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  API Sulfur JUN-2010 JUL-2010 AUG-2010 Average of   3 previous   months (1)  Arab Light 33.2 1.9 77.60 76.26 76.29 76.72  Arab Medium 30.5 2.4 75.84 74.59 74.62 75.02  Arab Heavy 27.6 2.8 74.34 73.32 73.25 73.64  Castilla 18.8 2.0 69.84 69.20 69.20 69.41  LLS 36.2 0.3 78.94 78.84 79.79 79.19  Mars 28.9 2.1 74.63 74.18 74.35 74.39  Maya 21.1 3.5 66.27 67.47 68.65 67.46  Napo 18.0 2.3 69.56 69.02 69.08 69.22  East 24.0 1.2 72.12 71.93 72.15 72.07  Vasconia 26.5 0.9 74.93 75.89 75.29 75.37\n\n(2) API, $/API-BBL Coefficient 0,495      (3) Sulfur, $%S-BBL (1,191)\n\nBank of Quality Coefficients       API Coefficient (0.50)  Sulfur Coefficient (1.19)\n\nSender Volume   injected   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nAPI in   the   injection   point\n\nSulfur in   the   injection   point\n\nRelative  value of   the crude   S$/BBL\n\nCalculated   Price   $/BBL\n\nTotal   Volume   adjusted   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nVolume   to adjust   MBBL/mo\n\nSender A 900 31 0.5 14.75 77.97 935 36  Sender B 1,200 26 1.0 11.69 74.90 1,195 (2)  Sender C 600 20 2.0 7.53 70.74 566 (34)  Total 2,700         2,700 -\n\n(1) Relative value calculated for mix 11.79  (2) Average price of exportation of mix, August 2012 75.00\n\n  47\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 2: DEFINITION OF STANDARD BARRELS PER SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n  48\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS     See File Annex 3 attached.

Payments in Advance:     ECOPETROL may accept payments in advance from clients having liquidity and/or who would like to benefit from discounts that ECOPETROL  may offer for the purchasing of specific services. Notwithstanding, each management office shall set out the discount policy for its line of services.     Payment in advance shall be requested to those who cannot offer any payment support through financial entities or offer collateral at satisfaction.     Credits of Confidence:     These are credits granted by ECOPETROL to clients with well recognized commercial and/or industrial history, or to clients that, even though they  are new have proved financial strength in the oil sector and its derivatives, biofuels and energy products with an impeccable payment history,  are classified in category 1 of internal rating Table 1 of these guidelines and execute promissory notes with letter or instructions in favor of  ECOPETROL .     Impeccable payment history is understood as the client who has timely paid its obligations with ECOPETROL, or with any other agent with whom  it as obligations within the payment terms set out in the bills, has acknowledged and paid all late interests resulting from any possible delays in  payments, and no payment instrument has been made effective from any agent with whom it has obligations to support for its purchases.

Price, Shipment and Payment 4.1. Price. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Products shall be established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits. The price that Sekisui shall pay for the Reagent Kits Products shall be based upon a formula intended to ensure that Sekisui will receive 90% of the total Available Margin for all Products during the first 12 months of this Agreement, 70% of the total Available Margin for all Products during months 13-24 of this Agreement, and 65% of the total Available Margin for all Products thereafter. Accordingly, the prices (established separately for the Reagent Kits and for the products other than Reagent Kits) to be paid by Sekisui for the Products shall be fixed (subject to a later lookback true up) for each respective prospective six month period in the manner set forth in Exhibit D.

Right of First Refusal. During the Term, Sekisui shall have a right of first refusal to match the terms of any arms length, bona fide proposed Sale Transaction with a Third Party (\"Sekisui's Right of First Refusal\"). Qualigen shall provide Sekisui with at least 30 days prior written notice and access to all due diligence materials provided to any potential acquirer, such 30 day period to commence upon the notification to Sekisui that Qualigen's board of directors has approved such Proposed Sale Transaction (as set forth in a term sheet or draft definitive agreement provided to Sekisui), subject to Sekisui's Right of First Refusal. At any time during such 30 day period, Sekisui may elect to match the terms of such proposal. Sekisui will be credited in any such proposal by the cumulative amount of all Financing Payments made to date. For example, if a Third Party offers to acquire Qualigen for $50,000,000 and Sekisui has funded the full $6,200,000 of Financing Payments, Sekisui's Right of First Refusal to match the proposed transaction would be a price of $43,800,000. In the event that Sekisui elects not to move forward with such proposal for a Sale Transaction, Qualigen shall have a period of 120 days to consummate a Sale Transaction on the same terms as provided to Sekisui. If a Sale Transaction has not been consummated within such 120 days period, any Sale Transaction must once again comply with the provisions of this Section 9.3. 13\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4. Penalty for Breach. In the event of any breach of Sections 9.1 through 9.3, including without limitation, any actions by stockholders of Qualigen that result in a Sale Transaction without complying with Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, or otherwise hinder the intent and purpose of the provisions of Sections 9.1 through 9.3 above, in addition to any other remedies available to Sekisui under the terms of this Agreement, including the right to specific performance and other equitable remedies, Sekisui shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of three times any and all Financing Payments made to date. For the avoidance of doubt, this clause does not apply to a failure of the stockholders of Qualigen to approve a Sale Transaction proposed by Sekisui, so long as such stockholders did not approve a Sale Transaction on the same terms with a Third Party during the Term. 9.5. Molecular Clinical Diagnostics. In furtherance of the foregoing, during the Exclusivity Period, Qualigen shall, in consultation with Sekisui, take commercially reasonable steps to seek to regain any rights in any Qualigen molecular clinical diagnostic product technology that Qualigen has previously granted to Gen-Probe, Hologic, or any of their affiliates. 10. Representations and Warranties 10.1. By Qualigen. Qualigen hereby represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Qualigen has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement, and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement, and to grant the rights herein, and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Qualigen.

(c) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge there is no patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (d) As of the Effective Date, Qualigen has not been notified with respect to, and to Qualigen's best knowledge no material actions are pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to any Product. (e) All Product delivered to Sekisui or Sekisui's customers pursuant to this Agreement, at the time of such delivery, shall not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of any applicable law, regulation or guideline effective at the time of delivery and shall not be an article which may not be introduced into interstate commerce under any applicable law, regulation or guideline. 14\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) The manufacturing facilities and processes utilized for the manufacture of each Product shall comply with applicable FDA regulations including, without limitation, applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices as described in 21 CFR 820. Qualigen does not represent, warrant or covenant that the Development Plan will be successfully accomplished, that the Development Plan will produce any particular results or any favorable results, that the Development Plan will result in any Development IP (or in any valuable Development IP), that the Products (if any) arising from the Development Plan can ever receive Regulatory Approvals or be successfully or profitably commercialized, or that any other current or future Products can be successfully or profitably commercialized by Sekisui. Moreover, Sekisui acknowledges and accepts the risks inherent in attempting to develop and commercialize any medical product. There is no implied representation that any Products can be successfully developed or commercialized. Qualigen shall provide to Sekisui and for the benefit of Sekisui's customers of Products a standard commercial written warranty that the Products will be free of defects in materials or workmanship starting from the date the Product has been received by Sekisui's customer and ending after the length of time stated for the applicable Product on Exhibit D hereto (the \"User Warranty\"). The User Warranty is contingent upon proper use of a Product in the application for which such Product was intended and does not cover Products that were altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from), that were used after the expiration date thereon or that were subjected by the carrier, distributor or the customer to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress. 10.2. By Sekisui. Sekisui represents, warrants and covenants that: (a) Sekisui has the full right, power and corporate authority to enter into this Agreement and to make the promises set forth in this Agreement and that there are no outstanding agreements, assignments or encumbrances in existence inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement and that this Agreement is enforceable against Sekisui. (b) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any patent infringement action pending before any court or governmental agency or other tribunal relating to Sekisui's sale or distribution of the Products. (c) As of the Effective Date, Sekisui has not been notified in writing with respect to, nor is there, to Sekisui's best knowledge, any action pending preventing Sekisui from selling and distributing the Products in the Territory. (d) Sekisui shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain before distribution of each Product, all licenses, registrations and permits required to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of such Product in the Territory. (e) Sekisui shall not make, or advise its customers to make, any alterations or modifications to, or any additions to or subtractions from, any Product. (f) Sekisui shall make no attempt to reverse-engineer any Product nor encourage or assist anyone else to do so. 15\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n10.3.

The express warranties set forth in this Section 10 and elsewhere in this Agreement are provided in lieu of, and EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS, all other warranties, express and implied, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, TO THE OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS OR THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR OF MERCHANTABILITY. Each Party's representations, warranties and/or covenants under this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Party and may be asserted only by the other Party and not by anyone else (including without limitation any customer of the other Party; provide, however, that end user customers may assert the User Warranty against Qualigen). 11. Indemnities 11.1. Indemnification by Sekisui. Sekisui shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Qualigen, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Qualigen Indemnitees\") from and against any and all claims, suits and proceedings by a Third Party (individually and collectively, \"Claims\"), and any and all losses, obligations, damages, deficiencies, costs, penalties, liabilities, assessments, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, fines and expenses (including court costs and reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys), incurred in the investigation, defense and/or settlement of any Claims (individually and collectively, \"Losses\"; it being expressly understood, however, that incidental, special, indirect and consequential damages and lost profits, lost savings and interruptions of business are expressly excluded therefrom and from such defined term): (a) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Sekisui or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives in the performance of Sekisui's obligations under this Agreement; or (b) arising out of or in connection with a breach or violation by Sekisui or its subdistributor of any applicable law or a material breach by Sekisui of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; provided, however, that Sekisui shall have no liability or obligation to any Qualigen Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Qualigen Indemnitee's breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 11.2. Indemnification by Qualigen. Qualigen shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sekisui and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the \"Sekisui Indemnitees\") from and against any and all Losses incurred in the investigation, defense and/ or settlement of any Claims: (a) related to bodily injury, death or property damage directly caused by any Product which has not been altered or modified (or added to or subtracted from) in any way, has been handled, stored, transported and used in accordance with Qualigen's guidelines and has not been used after its expiration date or subjected to abuse, mishandling or unusual physical, thermal, chemical or electrical stress; (b) arising out of the negligence or willful misconduct of Qualigen or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives; (c) arising out of a breach or violation by Qualigen of any applicable law or a material breach by Qualigen of any of its obligations under this Agreement, including any representations or warranties set forth herein; or (d) arising out of any claim that any of the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale, or use of any Product infringes upon any patent, proprietary, or intellectual property right of any Third Party in the Territory; provided, however, that Qualigen shall have no liability or obligation to any Sekisui Indemnitee for any Claims or Losses to the extent that such Claims or Losses are primarily caused by a Sekisui Indemnitee's (or any other entity or person within the Sekisui corporate family's) breach of applicable law, breach of this Agreement, negligence or willful misconduct. 16\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3. Patent Indemnity. Qualigen and Sekisui shall notify each other promptly in writing of any action (and all prior claims relating to such action) brought against Qualigen or Sekisui alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, and (provided that such a Claim does not arise from Sekisui's noncompliance with Sections 3.6, 8.4, 10.2(b), 10.2(c), 10.2(e) or 10.2(f) of this Agreement (e.g., Sekisui has altered a Product or has used a Sekisui trademark in connection with a Product)) Qualigen agrees to defend Sekisui in such action at its expense and shall pay any costs or damages finally awarded against Sekisui in any such action; provided, that Qualigen shall have had sole control of the defense of any such action and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise and provided further that no settlement or compromise shall be binding on a Party hereto without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event a lawsuit is filed against Sekisui or Qualigen alleging that the manufacture, marketing, import, offer for sale, sale or use of a Product constitute infringement of the intellectual property rights of a Third Party, or Qualigen files an action for declaratory judgment because of a serious threat of such a lawsuit, or if in Qualigen's reasonable business judgment a Product is likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement of a patent or other intellectual property right; then Qualigen may, at its expense, and may request Sekisui's assistance to, attempt to obtain a license to such patent or other intellectual property right. 11.4. Indemnification Procedures. The Party or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an \"Indemnified Party\") shall promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") of any Claim in respect of which the Indemnified Party intends to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) whether or not such Claim is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the number or circumstances of all Indemnified Parties. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably defend such Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying Party shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party and all other expenses of investigation and litigation. The Indemnified Party, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigations of any Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the indemnification of any Claim settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Also, if the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any such Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle such Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the entry of judgment upon) such Claim unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity by an Indemnified Party, no requirement that the Indemnified Party admit fault or culpability, and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and such settlement does not require the Indemnified Party to take (or refrain from taking) any action. 17\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of who controls the defense, the other Party hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested. Without limitation, the Party hereto which is not the Indemnifying Party and (if different) the Indemnified Party, and their respective directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any Claim. 11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4. 11.6. Insurance. Qualigen, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the Term, insurance policies with the minimum coverages set forth below (\"Insurance\"). Sekisui shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any Sekisui-owned coverage. (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence and $2,000,000 annual aggregate providing: \u25cf Assault and Battery coverage, \u25cf Broad form property damage coverage, \u25cf Broad form contractual liability coverage, \u25cf Products and completed operations coverage, and \u25cf Personal and advertising injury coverage. (b) Workers' Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance - With limits of liability for: \u25cf Workers' compensation as required by statute; \u25cf Employer's liability for bodily injury by accident: $500,000 each accident; bodily injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit; and bodily injury by disease: $500,000 each employee. All Qualigen's Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an A.M. Best rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by Sekisui. Qualigen shall provide Sekisui, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit Qualigen's responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of Qualigen's insurance policies. 12. Regulatory Matters 12.1. Regulatory Approval. Qualigen shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in the Applicable Markets. Qualigen shall hold in its name all Regulatory Approvals required for the marketing and sale of the Products in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing Regulatory Approvals. Qualigen and Sekisui shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required Regulatory Approvals. In addition, Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Regulatory Approval for any additional territories upon Sekisui's commercially reasonable request. 18\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2. Distribution Approvals. Sekisui shall be responsible for seeking, obtaining and maintaining (i) all licenses, registrations and permits (excluding patents) required to be obtained by Sekisui to enable Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) all approvals from the Regulatory Authorities regarding marketing and advertising materials to be used by Sekisui to promote the Product. Qualigen shall cooperate with Sekisui in making and maintaining all filings that may be necessary or desirable in connection with obtaining and maintaining any regulatory approvals necessary for Sekisui to act as a distributor of the Product in the Applicable Markets. 12.3. Communication With Agencies. In the Applicable Markets, Qualigen shall have responsibility for communications with the Regulatory Authorities concerning any required Regulatory Approvals, approval of Product related marketing and advertising materials, and Product quality matters. 12.4. Governmental Warnings. Each Party shall advise the other Party promptly (but in any event within no more than 48 hours) of any warning (including any FDA Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the Party, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the Product, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the Product, is affected. 12.5. Adverse Events, Recalls and Field Corrections. Qualigen shall have responsibility to determine whether any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections information must be reported to the FDA (under United States law) or any other Regulatory Authorities and Qualigen shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of Adverse Events, Recalls and/or Field Corrections to respective Regulatory Authorities for the Products. Qualigen shall provide prompt notice to Sekisui of any Adverse Events, Recalls or Field Corrections, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from Qualigen learning of such occurrence. 12.6. Complaints. Qualigen shall receive, investigate in a timely manner, and as appropriate, resolve customer complaints in the Territory. If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the Product, Qualigen shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a Product is returned by a customer for investigation, Qualigen shall ship a replacement Product to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of Product is due to a change of mind over using the Product or the Sekisui customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, Qualigen need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) Qualigen shall retain records of all Product related complaints, or Adverse Events for a period of not less than five (5) years beyond the expiration date of the Product or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. Qualigen shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within 90 days or less from the receipt of such complaint. 19\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n12.7. Product Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the Products be recalled or retrieved, or (iii) Qualigen and Sekisui reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the Products should be recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, Qualigen and/or Sekisui shall conduct such activity and the parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. Qualigen shall be responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction. In the event such action results from Sekisui's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Sekisui shall be responsible for the expenses thereof. Otherwise, Qualigen shall be responsible for the expenses of the action. Sekisui and Qualigen shall cooperate fully with one another in conducting any such action. Sekisui shall destroy units of Products lawfully recalled only upon Qualigen's (or any governmental authority's) written instruction to destroy such units of Products, and only then in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions. Otherwise, Sekisui shall return the recalled units of Product to Qualigen in accordance with Qualigen's procedures and instructions after completion of the action. 12.8. European Union Vigilance and Canada Mandatory Problem Reporting. In the event that Qualigen receives any Potentially Serious Complaints regarding the Products from a customer located in the European Union or Canada, then Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than (3) business days. If Qualigen receives a complaint from any Competent Authority or Health Canada with regard to the Products, Qualigen shall notify Sekisui promptly, but in any event within no more than 48 hours. Qualigen shall have the responsibility to correspond with the Competent Authority or Health Canada, as the Authorized Representative or Regulatory Correspondent, regarding any such complaints. If corrective actions are required, the cost of the corrective action shall be borne by Qualigen up to the extent such complaint is related to the manufacturing of the Products by Qualigen, or some other cause or event attributable to Qualigen, and shall be borne by Sekisui up to the extent such complaint is due to some other cause or event attributable to Sekisui. 20\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n13. Confidential Information; Audit Rights 13.1. Confidentiality Obligation. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this Agreement each Party may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this Agreement or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the Term and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving Party shall disclose the other Party's Confidential Information only to its own (or its Affiliates') officers, employees, consultants, Third Party service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party without the other's prior written consent. In all events, however, any and all disclosure to a Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse agreement no less restrictive than this Section 13 (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The Party which disclosed Confidential Information of the other to any Third Party (or to any such Affiliate) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third Party or Affiliate (or its disclosees) which would have violated this Agreement if committed by the Party itself. Neither Party shall use Confidential Information of the other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this Agreement or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this Agreement or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the Term, by Qualigen only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former Sekisui customers of Products. Each Party shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other's Confidential Information as it would customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own Confidential Information (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, each Party, upon the other's request, promptly shall return or destroy all the Confidential Information disclosed to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement, including all copies, reflections, analyses and extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the Party's computer systems, network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive under this Agreement. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall not apply to any Confidential Information, or portion thereof, that the receiving Party can demonstrate: (a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain; 21\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving Party or its disclosees; (c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving Party's possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior possession can be demonstrated by the receiving Party by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this Agreement that was subject to a confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure); (d) is rightfully received by the receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third Party without obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving Party's best knowledge, such information was not obtained by said Third Party, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing Party; or (e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving Party, in either case solely by personnel without any access to or use of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, as shown by receiving Party's contemporaneous written records. In the event either Party must disclose the other Party's Confidential Information in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such Party shall give reasonable advance notice to the other Party of such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing Party may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the Confidential Information so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued. The Parties acknowledge that the defined term \"Confidential Information\" shall include not only a disclosing Party's own Confidential Information but also Confidential Information of an Affiliate or of a Third Party which is in the possession of a disclosing Party. However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other Party any Confidential Information of a Third Party which is in the possession of such Party, unless the other Party has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such Confidential Information) to receive such particular Confidential Information. 22\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either Sekisui or Qualigen from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. Sekisui and Qualigen do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other Party or the other Party's legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other Party that it has made such reports or disclosures. 13.2. Use of Names. During the Term, Sekisui is hereby permitted to use the Qualigen name and any Qualigen content (including the content of any existing sales collateral and marketing materials) in any sales collateral, marketing materials or other communications used in connection with the marketing and sales of the Product with the prior written consent of Qualigen, which consent shall not be reasonably withheld or delayed. Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other Party, during the Term neither Qualigen nor Sekisui shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third Party, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other Party. 13.3. Press Releases. Neither Party shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing Party within the time frames required by law; provided, however, that the disclosing Party provides the non-disclosing Party with notice of the legally required time frame for the approval of the disclosure. Neither Party shall use the trademark or logo of the other Party, its Affiliates or their respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, except as may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other Party, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in Sekisui's advertisement, promotion and sale of the Products in compliance with this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either Party shall be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval. 13.4. Audit Rights. Each Party shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement and enable the other Party to determine the correctness of any report made under this Agreement and monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this Agreement through the process below. Upon reasonable written notice (and no more often than once every 150 days), the auditing Party shall have the right, during normal business hours, to audit the books and records maintained by the audited Party pursuant to this Agreement to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder. 23\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14. Termination 14.1. Termination by Either Party. Either Party may terminate this Agreement (i) immediately upon written notice in the event of the closing of a Sale Transaction; or (ii) immediately upon written notice if the other files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or becomes subject to any order for relief or involuntary bankruptcy petition under any bankruptcy, liquidation, insolvency or similar law which is not dismissed within 60 days. 14.2. Termination by Qualigen. Qualigen may terminate this Agreement (i) upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of any failure of Sekisui to make a Financing Payment that is determined to be due, which failure is not cured within such 30 day period, or (ii) upon sixty (60) days prior written notice in the event of any material breach of the diligence obligations (which is understood not to include failing to meet forecasts for sales to customers) set forth in the Business Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), which breach is not cured within such 60 day period. 14.3. Termination by Sekisui. Sekisui may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice (i) in the event of any failure of Qualigen to meet a milestone set forth in the Development Plan (as it may be amended by the Parties from time to time), or (ii) at any other time upon ninety (90) days' prior written notice of impending termination. 14.4. Effect of Termination. Sections 4.6, 5.5, 8.1, 8.2, 11.1-11.4, 13, 14.4 and 15 shall survive the later of the expiration or termination of the Term. In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this Agreement contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time following termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive only for the specified period of time. Upon the expiration or termination of the Term, (i) Sekisui shall cooperate in permitting Qualigen to offer to rehire any Sekisui sales representatives who are primarily responsible for selling the Products as set forth in Section 4.6, (ii) Sekisui shall transfer to Qualigen the ownership of any Sekisui Instruments (subject to reimbursement from Qualigen for the book value (original cost less depreciation) of such Sekisui Instruments), (iii) Qualigen shall reimburse Sekisui for a prorated portion of all prepaid distribution fees paid by Sekisui during the final year of this Agreement to subdistributors, (iv) Sekisui shall assign to Qualigen each subdistributor agreement which Qualigen requests be assigned to Qualigen, and (v) each Party shall remain liable for its obligations accrued before the effective date of such expiration or termination (and for avoidance of doubt: upon expiration or termination Sekisui shall remain liable to pay Qualigen all Financing Payments then due under the Development Plan based upon the milestones that Qualigen has completed by the date of such expiration or termination). In the event there are unfulfilled orders for Products outstanding as of termination of this Agreement, Sekisui may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to Qualigen (in which case Qualigen agrees to fill such orders to Sekisui's end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause Qualigen to fulfill such orders and invoice Sekisui for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either Party is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the Term, it shall conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the ordinary course) for the duration of the Term. 24\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15. Miscellaneous 15.1. Independent Contractor. For the purpose of the Agreement each Party shall be, and shall be deemed to be, an independent contractor and not an agent, partner, joint venturer or employee of the other Party. Neither Party shall have authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action which shall be binding on the other Party (except as may be explicitly provided for herein or authorized in writing), and each Party agrees not to purport to do so. 15.2. Assignment. The Agreement shall not be assigned and is not assignable or delegable by either Party without the written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that Sekisui and Qualigen each may assign this Agreement without the consent of the other to a successor in connection with the merger, consolidation or sale of such Party or of all or substantially all of its assets or the portion of its business to which this Agreement relates. 15.3. No Waiver. Failure of either Party to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this Agreement arising out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a Party of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement in any instance shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof. 15.4. Severability. This Agreement is divisible and separable. If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 15.5. Notices. All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and made (i) if by personal delivery, on the date of such delivery, (ii) if by recognized overnight courier specifying next-business-day delivery, on the next business day after the date of deposit with such courier (by the courier's stated time for enabling next-business-day delivery), (iii) if by email, on the date sent by email if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next business day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, and (iv) if by US registered mail, on the fifth business day following such mailing in the US, in each case addressed at the address shown below for, or such other address as may be designated by 10 days' advance written notice hereunder by, such Party.

Entire Agreement and Modification. The Agreement, including the Exhibits thereto, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and cancels any previous or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral, written or implied, heretofore in effect, including any letter of intent, and sets forth the entire agreement between Sekisui and Qualigen with respect to the subject matter hereof (provided, that any and all previous nondisclosure/nonuse obligations, including the July 7, 2015 Confidential Disclosure Agreement) are not superseded and remain in full force and effect for all disclosures made prior to the date of this Agreement). Each Party acknowledges that it has not relied, in deciding whether to enter into this Agreement on this Agreement's expressly stated terms and conditions, on any representations, warranties, agreements, commitments or promises which are not expressly set forth within this Agreement. No agreements amending, altering, supplementing or waiving the terms hereof may be made except by the express terms of a written document signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties. 15.7. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement. 15.8. Attorney Fees. If litigation becomes necessary to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, the successful Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party reasonable expenses, including attorneys' and other professional fees, in addition to any other available remedies. 26\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.9. Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and are in no way intended to describe, interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or any provision hereof. 15.10. Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement may be delivered by email attachment or other electronic transmission, and such signatures and such delivery shall be fully effective and binding on the Party sending the same. 15.11. Further Assurances. Each Party covenants and agrees to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such further or other documents and instruments and take any such further or other action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement. 15.12. Force Majeure. No Party shall be liable to any other Party or be deemed to have breached or defaulted under this Agreement for failure or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than obligations for the payment of money) for the time and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts of God, earthquake, riot, civil commotion, terrorism, war, strikes or other labor disputes, fire, flood, failure or delay of transportation, omissions or delays in acting by a governmental authority, acts of a government or an agency thereof or judicial orders or decrees or restrictions or any other like reason which is beyond the control of the respective Party. The Party affected by force majeure shall provide the other Party with full particulars thereof as soon as it becomes aware of the same (including its best estimate of the likely extent and duration of the interference with its activities), and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the difficulties created thereby and to resume performance of its obligations hereunder as soon as practicable, and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the duration of the force majeure. 15.13. Equitable Relief. Each Party recognizes that the covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect the legitimate interests of the other Party, that the other Party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a Party's breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements will cause the opposed Party irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate. Therefore, each Party agrees that an opposed Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of Section 13 and all other provisions of this Agreement, and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), without the necessity of posting of any bond or security. This right shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other Party at law or in equity. 15.14. Rights and Remedies are Cumulative. Except to the extent as may be expressly set forth herein, all rights, remedies, undertakings, obligations and agreements contained in or available upon violation of this Agreement shall be cumulative and none of them shall be in limitation of any other remedy or right authorized in law or in equity, or any undertaking, obligation or agreement of the applicable Party. 27\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n15.15. Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as expressly set forth in Section 11, the terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors or permitted assigns and it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person. 15.16. No Implied License. No right or license is granted to Sekisui by implication, estoppel, or otherwise to any know-how, patent or other intellectual property right owned or controlled by Qualigen. 15.17. Exhibits.

Actual 'Gross to Net' (GTN) Adjustments - consist of: a) discounts, refunds, rebates, sub distributor \"channel\" fees, chargebacks, retroactive price adjustments, and any other allowances given and taken which effectively reduce the net selling price (other than such which have already diminished the gross amount invoiced), including, without limitation, volume discounts. b) Product returns and allowances Net Revenue - Actual Gross Revenue less Actual GTN Adjustments Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Components of COGS include: Actual Material Costs - Consists of: \u25cf Qualigen Bill of Material (BOM) Standard Costs (for instrument, reagent kit and related consumable products sold by Sekisui): \u25cb raw materials \u25cb component materials \u25cb packaging materials \u25cf Allocated standard shipping material costs, including envirocoolers, shipping boxes and filler materials \u25cf Actual cost of ice packs \u25cf Actual outbound freight expense (as applicable based on shipping terms) for sales and rentals of instruments, and sales of reagents and related consumables. Exhibit A-1\n\nSource: RITTER PHARMACEUTICALS INC, S-4/A, 3/13/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(Note: Qualigen records costs of raw material, component, packaging and shipping materials (excluding ice packs) at standard, and records manufacturing variances including purchase price and material usage variances as part of Labor & Overhead. If Qualigen's manufacturing variances exceed 3% of its total production costs in any True-Up Period referenced in Exhibit D, such variances are to be allocated between inventory and COGS based on total inventory turns for the applicable True-Up Period) Actual Labor & Overhead Costs - Consists of: Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing Cost Center Expenses - Including direct instrument and reagent manufacturing-related wages and related taxes and benefits, direct Property Plant & Equipment depreciation, direct production supplies, direct production-related repairs & maintenance expenses, inbound freight expenses, material variances and allocated manufacturing-related occupancy expenses for expenses such as rent, utilities, janitorial services, telephone expense, supplies and depreciation. Reagent manufacturing also includes an allocation of R&D department expenses relating to formulation oversight. In Qualigen's FY 2016 financial data, this allocation represented approximately $60k. Workers' comp insurance is included as part of the occupancy allocation in Qualigen's FY2016 financial results. Beginning with Qualigen's FY 2017 financial reporting, Workers' comp insurance will be included as a direct allocation to the Instrument and Reagent Manufacturing cost centers based on salary amounts. Quality Cost Center Expenses - Including wages and related taxes and benefits, equipment repairs and maintenance expenses, professional consulting services, supplies, dues & subscriptions, filing fees, depreciation and allocated Quality occupancy expenses.

Currently, the Medical Device Excise Tax provision of the Affordable Care Act is repealed (from Jan. 2016 through December 2017). However, should this provision be re-enacted, or similar such provision enacted, the cost of such excise taxes will be included as a cost element included in Actual Cost of Goods. The margin share and true-up process will reflect this cost.

The first true-up will be based on a stub period consisting of results from the first day of this Agreement to September 30, 2016. Table B below provides the true-up periods and Available Margin shares.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Diplomat shall not manufacture, sell or dispose of any products covered by this license after (a) the expiration of the license, or (b) the termination of the license based on (i) the failure of Diplomat to affix notice of copyright, trademark or service mark registration or any other notice to the products, cartons, containers, or packing or wrapping material or advertising, promotional or display material, or (ii) because of the departure by Diplomat from the quality and style approved by KI, Inc. pursuant to paragraph 9.\n\n            17. Effect of Termination or Expiration.\n\n            Upon and after the expiration or termination of this license, all rights granted to Diplomat hereunder shall forthwith revert to KI, Inc., who shall be free to license others to use KI's name in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of the products covered hereby, and Diplomat will refrain from further use of KI's name or any further reference to it, direct or indirect, or anything deemed by KI, Inc. to be similar to the KI's name, in connection with the manufacture, sale or distribution of Diplomat's products, except as provided in paragraph 17.\n\n                                       10\n\n            18. KI, Inc.'s Remedies.\n\n                  (a) Diplomat acknowledges that (except as otherwise provided       herein) its failure to commence in good faith to manufacture and       distribute in commercial quantities any one or more of the products listed       in subparagraph 2(a) within three (3) months of the date of this Agreement       and to continue during the term hereof to diligently and continuously       manufacture, distribute and sell the products covered by this Agreement,       or any class or category thereof, will result in immediate damages to KI,       Inc.\n\n                  (b) Diplomat also acknowledges that (except as otherwise       provided herein) its failure to cease the manufacture, sale or       distribution of the products covered by this Agreement, or any class or       category thereof, at the termination or expiration of this Agreement will       result in immediate and irremediable damage to KI, Inc. and to the rights       of any subsequent licensee. Diplomat acknowledges and admits that there is       no adequate remedy at law for such failure to cease manufacture, sale or       distribution, and Diplomat agrees that in the event of such failure KI,       Inc. shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of temporary and       permanent injunctions and such other further relief as any court with       jurisdiction may deem just and proper.\n\n                  (c) Resort to any remedies herein shall not be construed as a       waiver of any other rights and remedies to which KI, Inc. is entitled       under this Agreement or otherwise.\n\n            19. Excuse for Nonperformance.\n\n            Diplomat shall be released from its obligations hereunder and this license shall terminate in the event that governmental regulations or other\n\n\n\n\n\ncauses arising out of a state of national emergency, war, or causes beyond the control of the parties render performance impossible and one party so informs the other in writing of such causes and its desire to be so released. In such events, all royalties on sales theretofore made shall become immediately due and payable and no minimum royalties shall be repayable.\n\n            20. No Joint Venture.\n\n            Nothing herein contained shall be construed to place the parties in the relationship of partners or joint venturers, and Diplomat shall have no power to obligate or bind KI, Inc. in any manner whatsoever.\n\n            21. No Assignment or Sublicense by Diplomat.\n\n            This Agreement and all rights and duties hereunder are personal to Diplomat and shall not, without the written consent of KI, Inc., be assigned, mortgaged, sublicensed or otherwise encumbered by Diplomat or by operation of law.\n\n                                       11\n\n            KI, Inc. may assign its rights hereunder, but shall furnish written notice of such assignment to Diplomat.\n\n            22. No Waiver, Etc.\n\n            None of the terms of this Agreement can be waived or modified except by an express Agreement in writing signed by both parties. There are no representations, promises, warranties, covenants or undertakings other than those contained in this Agreement, which represents the entire understanding of the parties. The failure of either party hereto to enforce, or the delay by either party in enforcing, any of its rights under this Agreement shall not be deemed a continuing waiver or a modification thereof and either party may, within the time provided by applicable law, commence appropriate legal proceedings to enforce any or all of such rights. No person, firm, group or corporation (whether included in KI's name or otherwise) other than Diplomat and KI, Inc. shall be deemed to have acquired any rights by reason of anything contained in this Agreement, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 22.\n\n            23. Additional Endorsers. If, during the term of this Agreement, Diplomat should utilize the services of any other person to endorse its products, and the public image of such person is so inconsistent with that of KI as to risk damaging the good will of KI's name should KI, Inc. continue to do business with Diplomat, then KI, Inc. shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, subject to the remedial and other provisions of paragraph 14 of this Agreement.\n\n            24. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\n                  (a) Authority. KI, Inc. has the full right, power, legal       capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of KI, to       carry out its terms, and to grant Diplomat the rights, licenses and       privileges granted in this Agreement.\n\n                  (b) Merger. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior       written or oral agreements between the parties.\n\n                  (c) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and       construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without       regard to conflict of law principles.\n\n                  (d) Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing party in any proceeding       brought to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to       recover the reasonable fees and costs of its counsel, plus all other costs       of such proceeding.\n\n                  (e) Notices. All notices and statements to be given, payments       to be made and materials to be submitted under this Agreement shall be       given, made and submitted via certified or registered mail, postage       prepaid, return\n\n                                       12\n\n      receipt requested, at the addresses of the parties, as set forth above,       unless notification of a change of address is given in writing, and the       date of mailing shall be deemed the date the notice or statement is given.\n\n            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first set forth above.\n\n                                    /s/ Kathy Ireland                                                        ---------------------------------                                     KATHY IRELAND, Individually                                                                                                               KATHY IRELAND, INC.

Oxbow and Global each may be referred to from time to time herein as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties\".    RECITALS    WHEREAS, Oxbow is a world leader in petroleum coke trading, marketing, sales, and shipping; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a world leader in petroleum coke gasification, having optimized operations of the leading petroleum coke gasification technology, EGAS\u2122 technology, at its Wabash gasification facility in Indiana; and    WHEREAS, Oxbow leases a marine terminal site in Texas City, Texas which it believes to be well-suited for installation of petroleum coke gasification technology, in that gasification would optimize Oxbow's flexibility in the sale and use of petroleum coke currently stored on the site, which could be converted into pipeline SNG or hydrogen, as well as being shipped onward to Oxbow's traditional petroleum coke customers; and    WHEREAS, Global Energy is a leader in the development and permitting of gasification facilities, and currently is the only gasification facility owner/operator with permits to construct new gasification facilities (specifically, its Lima and Westfield Projects); and    WHEREAS, the Parties believe that an alliance as described in this Agreement will prove mutually beneficial;    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:    AGREEMENT    1. Purchase of Shares. Global Energy shall issue and sell to Oxbow, and Oxbow shall purchase from Global Energy, on the Closing Date, Twenty-Five Thousand (25,000) common shares of Global Energy (the \"Shares\"), on the following terms and conditions, and subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6 hereof:    (a) Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares shall be Five Million and No/100 Dollars ($5,000,000.00), or $200.00 per Share.      1\n\n\n\n\n\n    (b) Payment. Payment of the Purchase Price shall be made on the Closing Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to Global Energy, as applicable, at the applicable account designated by Global Energy, as follows:                                           Bank:     PNC Bank, N.A.

(c) Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 6, the closing of the purchase of the Shares (the \"Closing\") shall take place at 11:00 a.m., on December 22, 2006 (such date of closing referred to herein as the \"Closing Date\") at the offices of Oxbow, 1601 Forum Place, Suite 1400, West Palm Beach, Florida 33401, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. At the Closing, Oxbow shall pay to Global Energy the Purchase Price and Global Energy shall deliver to Oxbow a stock certificate evidencing the issuance to Oxbow of the Shares. The Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time, on the Closing Date.    2. Strategic Alliance. The Parties hereby form a strategic alliance having the following key elements:    (a) Preferred Suppliers. Oxbow and Global Energy hereby designate one another as their preferred suppliers of certain goods and services, as follows:    (i) Oxbow shall be the preferred petroleum coke supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (ii) Oxbow shall be a preferred supplier of coal, coal fines, gob or waste coal products (collectively, \"Coal\") to gasification projects owned or controlled by Global Energy.    (iii) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification technology supplier to petroleum coke gasification projects majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.    (iv) Global Energy shall be the preferred gasification project operator for petroleum coke gasification projects at sites majority owned or controlled by Oxbow.      2\n\n\n\n\n\n    (b) Further Cooperation. The Parties also agree to cooperate in good faith as follows in furtherance of their strategic alliance:    (i) Oxbow will identify Oxbow petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Global Energy.    (ii) Global Energy will identify Global Energy petroleum coke related sites for collaboration with Oxbow.    The obligations of the Parties pursuant to this Section 2 are subject to continued demonstrated performance and their mutual agreement on the schedule, pricing, financing, economics and other terms and conditions applicable to any such project.    3. Lima Project. In addition to the strategic alliance described in Section 2 of this Agreement, the parties specifically agree to the following with respect to Global Energy's proposed Lima, Ohio gasification project (the \"Lima Project\"):    (a) Investment by Oxbow. Oxbow will make a investment (the \"Lima Investment\") in the company which owns the Lima Project (the \"Lima Project Company\") in the amount of [*], as consideration for obtaining the fuel supply management agreement for the Lima Project and the other revenues and benefits described in this Section 3. Oxbow's obligation to make this investment would be subject to:    (i) Oxbow obtaining the consent of its existing lenders; and    (ii) Global Energy securing one or more firm written commitments in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Oxbow for at least Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) of equity funding for the Lima Project, or in the alternative, evidence demonstrating that Global has available cash of Two Hundred Seventeen Million and No/100 Dollars ($217,000,000.00) in its account.    (iii) Global Energy providing evidence satisfactory to Oxbow in its reasonable discretion that it has secured the right to purchase the site for the Lima Project from the City of Lima, Ohio for a purchase price of One Million Five Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,500,000.00).    (b) Revenues and Benefits to Oxbow. If Oxbow makes the Lima Investment:    (i) Oxbow will receive four percent (4%) of the Lima Project's pre-tax project cash flow after debt service and operation and maintenance (\"O&M\") expenses. The Lima Project Company's obligation to make such payment would be subject to satisfaction of the same lender covenants which will apply to distributions to equity investors in the Lima Project; and      3\n\n\n\n\n\n    (ii) Oxbow will receive two percent (2%) of those non-O&M revenues of Global Energy's affiliate, Gasification Engineering Corporation, Inc. (\"GEC\") related to the Lima Project (e.g., any of the $200 million EPC reserves/construction contingency which is not spent).    (iii) Oxbow will have a seat on the Board of Directors of GEC or any subsidiary or affiliate of GEC which is responsible for the engineering, procurement and construction (\"EPC\") contract for the Lima Project.    (c) Fuel Management and Supply Agreement. In addition, if Oxbow makes the Lima Investment, Oxbow and Global Energy will enter into a fuel management and supply agreement (the \"Fuel Management and Supply Agreement\") for all fuel to be utilized by the Lima Project, which would include the following material provisions:    (i) Oxbow will manage all fuel coke and Coal supply and logistics for the Lima Project.    (ii) Oxbow will be paid a management fee of One Million and No/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) per year, such fee to be paid irrespective of actual Coal or petroleum coke use by the Lima Project.    (iii) As fuel supply manager, Oxbow will receive a base commission of $0.12 per MMBTU consumed by the Lima Project, independent of fuel type (the \"Base Commission\"). As an incentive to obtain the lowest cost of fuel throughout the life of the Lima Project, the Lima Project Company would receive two-thirds (2/3) of any cost savings below $1.07 per MMBTU delivered to the project (such price, the \"Price Basis\"), escalated each year beginning in 2009 in accordance with increases in the Consumer Price Index, and Oxbow would receive one- third (1/3) of any such cost savings. Should the price of fuel delivered to the Lima Project be above the Price Basis, the commission will be reduced on a sliding scale according to the following formula:    C= BC+(PB-PI)*0.1094    Where:    C = commission  BC = Base Commission  PI = price invoiced per MMBTU  PB = Price Basis per MMBTU    However, the commission will never be less than $0.05 per MMBTU regardless of fuel price. For purposes of calculating this commission, the price of all fuel supply transactions would be based on the direct cost of supply and transportation expenses as invoiced.      4\n\n\n\n\n\n    (iv) Global Energy may provide up to ten percent (10%) of the annual fuel requirements of the Lima Project from renewable sources. Oxbow would receive the same commission on a per-BTU basis on any such fuel supplied by Global Energy.    (d) Project Management. In the event Oxbow funds its investment in the Lima Project Company as set forth in Section 3(a), and either or both of the following occur:       (i)  Closing and funding of the Lima Project financing does not occur on or before December 15, 2007; or       (ii)  There is a delay of twelve months or more in meeting any project milestones as set forth in Schedule 3(d) (\"Project Milestones\");    then Oxbow shall have the right to take over the development and management of the Lima Project; provided, however, that the Lima Project fuel supply arrangements shall continue to be managed as set forth in the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement and Oxbow shall not be entitled to direct the disposition of ownership interests in the Lima Project Company, unless additional equity is required to finance the project. Further, if Oxbow elects to take over the development and management of the Lima Project and Oxbow subsequently determines that it does not desire to continue to participate in the Lima Project, it may withdraw from further participation, relinquish its economic interests in the Lima Project Company and GEC and terminate the Fuel Management and Supply Agreement, without further liability or obligation to Global Energy and/or the other Lima Project participants.    4.
